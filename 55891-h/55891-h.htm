<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="small">INTRODUCING THE FAMILY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"One! two! right! left! one! two! Number
Three, you are not in line. Forward a little!
That's it. Now then&mdash;one! two! right! left!"</p>

<p>It was early morning of a midsummer day, and
a dozen or more boys, between the ages of ten
and fifteen, marched out of the market town of
Morainville, some armed with wooden swords,
and others with broom-handles which did service
as rifles, while the most of them were eating
big slices of bread with keen relish.</p>

<p>"One! two! right! left!"</p>

<p>The time of the annual f&#234;te, when the soldiers
would come, was drawing near, and for several
days the youngsters of the place had been preparing
to receive them in fitting manner.</p>

<p>All their usual forms of play had for the nonce
been abandoned in favor of drilling, and grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
councils of war, and much attention was given
to the making of wooden swords and guns
wherewith to more closely imitate the soldiers.</p>

<p>Then came the important matter of choosing
the officers, which, however, were always the
same, because the smaller boys never failed to
vote for the bigger ones, knowing well that if
they didn't they would assuredly get a licking.</p>

<p>A couple of boys in the party had a special
talent for imitating the trumpet by placing their
shut hand over their closed lips, and these led the
little troop.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock the children had marched over
a mile, and reached the top of a hill planted with
spruce trees on both sides of the road which
slanted sharply in front and rear of their route.</p>

<p>The captain of the company ordered a halt, and
as their young legs were pretty tired, it was
decided that they should there await the arrival
of the soldiers.</p>

<p>A sentinel was placed on the road to report the
appearance of the regiment in good time to allow
the boys to get ready for its reception.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, as the little soldiers of the
wooden swords waited beneath the spruce trees,
the sentinel from his post of observation gave
the signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah! there they are!" cried the boys
delightedly, and they made haste to draw up in
line along the road.</p>

<p>But it was not the regiment that came in
view. No red trousers showed upon the horizon.
Nothing save a big lumbering wagon, a mountebank's
van drawn by a single horse, made its
appearance, moving in the direction of the town.</p>

<p>Yet the sight of this solitary van would not of
itself have sufficed to attract the curiosity of the
children. Strolling performers! why, they were
nothing uncommon. They visited the town often
in the course of the year, and one poor shabby van
could never have constituted a counter-attraction
to the most insignificant soldier in his red
trousers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the youngsters stood there upon
the road like statues, and, after their first exclamation
of surprise, they were silent also, while their
eyes fairly bulged from their sockets as they
gazed open-mouthed upon that which was coming
towards them.</p>

<p>Beside the van moved the huge bulk of something
unknown that stalked solemnly along,
looking neither to right nor left.</p>

<p>What could it be? So tremendous a creature
had never crossed their vision before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>"Can it be a beast?" whispered one of the boys
with trembling lips.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes&mdash;" responded the captain, making
a gallant effort to appear unconcerned, although
he was greatly excited, "a beast that can walk."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, bewildering. A monster beside
which the horse that drew the van seemed no
bigger than a dog&mdash;a monster whose height exceeded
that of the mountebank's house on wheels.</p>

<p>Then to one of the boys came an inspiration,
and he cried proudly:</p>

<p>"I know what it is. I saw the picture of one
in a book my father was showing me. It's an
elephant!"</p>

<p>"What a whopper! an elephant's not a great
brute like that. You don't know what you're
talking about," snapped the captain, ill-pleased at
a private having ventured an explanation of the
wonder.</p>

<p>This silenced the youngster, and as none of the
others could offer any better suggestion the little
company, feeling decidedly nervous, made haste
to climb the trees that lined the road just as the
mountebanks and their elephant reached the top
of the hill. Like a band of frightened monkeys
they got among the branches uttering cries of
fear, and then, with the effrontery of monkeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
took their positions as close as possible to the
road so that they might obtain a full view of the
strolling performers, and of the wonderful animal
that sauntered so peacefully along beside their
conveyance.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid," called out one of the
mountebanks reassuringly. He was only a boy
himself, and his keen eyes had taken in the situation
at a glance. "There's no harm in Nalla. He
wouldn't hurt anybody unless they hurt him first."</p>

<p>And as he spoke the lad stroked lovingly the
trunk of the great creature that responded to the
caress with little grunts of satisfaction.</p>

<p>At this assurance all the boys descended from
their refuge in the trees, and in a gingerly hesitating
fashion, for they were still a little nervous,
drew near the boy who was so manifestly in the
good graces of the monster.</p>

<p>What puzzled the boys was that they saw no
sign of either the father or mother of the little
players, of whom there were four, two boys and
two girls.</p>

<p>On the front platform of the van sat a girl of
not more than sixteen, holding in her lap another
of about five years of age.</p>

<p>"Come now&mdash;Steady&mdash;hurry up!" cried the
latter to the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! let him alone! he's going as fast as he
can, Lydia," said the elder one. "It's no use
shouting at him."</p>

<p>But Steady did not mend his pace. He well deserved
his name, for indeed a slower animal never
wore harness.</p>

<p>Behind the van came another youngster, not
more than ten years old, followed by a black dog
clipped so as to faintly resemble a lion. The
boy and dog were evidently on the best of
terms, and the one no less full of life than the
other.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the whole party of
boys, who had come out to receive the soldiers,
completely forgot them in the novelty of this
strange party, and constituted themselves a guard
of honor for Nalla and his friends without giving
another thought to the red trousers which had
been the original cause of their early morning
march-out.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the town was a sort of open
square formed by the joining of two roads, and
it was there that the owners of the van, the
Tamby family, had taken their stand when the
expected soldiers, with fife and drums leading,
at last marched into Morainville.</p>

<p>As they watched them pass, looking very imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
indeed in all their martial splendor, little
C&#230;sar Tamby said to Nadine his sister:</p>

<p>"The soldiers! We have got here in the nick
of time. We ought to take in a lot of money to-night."</p>

<p>But Nadine, whose pretty features wore a sad
expression, shook her head doubtfully:</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" she murmured. "Perhaps
the Mayor won't allow us to give a performance."</p>

<p>She was going to find out, and she took with
her the necessary papers to make a formal request
for the authorization.</p>

<p>Nadine, the eldest of the Tamby family, who
undertook the always tiresome, and often troublesome
task of securing the necessary permission
for the little troupe to make a stay within the
bounds of a commune, and give public performances,
set off with no loss of time.</p>

<p>She quickly made her way to the center of the
town where the Mayor's office was situated, but
there encountered a lot of soldiers receiving directions
from their officers in regard to their stay at
Morainville. It was accordingly with some difficulty
that she was able to reach the office of the
Mayor, which was crowded with officers who were
engaging his attention.</p>

<p>His worship was informed that a mountebank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
wished to see him about obtaining permission to
make a stay in the town.</p>

<p>"I've no time to waste upon such folk, and,
moreover, I won't give the permission because the
soldiers are here," was his ungracious reply as
conveyed to the anxious Nadine by the constable,
who, noting her disappointment, added in a kinder
tone on his own account:</p>

<p>"My young girl, the Mayor won't see you, and
as he has given his answer to your request you
may take my word for it that it's useless for you
to wait about here. You'd better push on to some
other town where you'll have a chance to give a
performance."</p>

<p>"But, sir," pleaded Nadine, her lip trembling,
and her fine eyes filling with tears, "if we don't
perform this evening we shall have nothing to
eat to-morrow. We might get along somehow
ourselves, but our animals, they must be fed."</p>

<p>The constable was touched by her plea, and the
charm of her simple manner.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," he responded, laying his
big hand upon her shoulder in a fatherly way.
"You'll have to try and see the Mayor at his
own house," and the kind-hearted fellow gave
Nadine directions how to find it, and what to do
when she got there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>The Mayor's residence was quite a castle, and
Nadine felt very timid about venturing to enter
it, but she found the great portal open, and
glided through without being observed by any
one in the establishment, the fact of the matter
being that on this day everybody had their hands
too full to concern themselves about who might
be going or coming.</p>

<p>The staff of domestics seemed to be exceedingly
busy. Several women in snow-white dresses were
hard at work before the cooking range, one of
them giving orders in a sharp voice, and the
others replying promptly:</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame Fran&#231;oise," and carrying out
her instructions.</p>

<p>A moment later Madame Fran&#231;oise caught
sight of Nadine who stood shyly in the doorway,
not daring to enter a place where everybody was
so engrossed with their work.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what do you want?" she
demanded in a tone of irritation as she fixed her
eyes on the young girl, and examined her from
her head to her feet. "Where did you come
from?" she snapped.</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Nadine in a low-toned
voice, letting her head drop upon her breast. "I
came to see the Mayor, and to beg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;we've no time for beggars to-day,"
cried Madame impatiently, "and the Mayor
won't be able to see you. Be off with you as
quick as you can!"</p>

<p>Nadine turned to leave with heavy heart when
a door on the other side of the kitchen opened
suddenly, and a lady of middle age, in a rich silk
gown, entered the room. She was tall and handsome,
and her expression was so sweet and pleasant
that somehow Nadine's hopes began to revive.</p>

<p>"Was it you, Fran&#231;oise, who spoke so sharply
to the child?" she asked in a tone that expressed
both surprise and reproof.</p>

<p>"Well, Madame," replied the servant, "you see
this is one of those little beggars, a mountebank's
daughter, who pay a visit to the town just for
what they can steal. She came here begging and
I told her that you had no time to attend to her."</p>

<p>The color flew to Nadine's face, and her eyes
flashed with indignation at these words which
were no less unjust than they were cruel.</p>

<p>She lifted her pretty head with a touch of pride,
and her voice rang out clearly as she hastened to
say:</p>

<p>"But I didn't come here begging, Madame.
I've never had to do anything of the kind yet,
thank God. I simply came to ask permission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the Mayor to make my living in an honest way.
That's what I'm here for, I assure you," and she
made a respectful courtesy to the lady.</p>

<p>"But why didn't your father come instead, my
child?" asked the lady, regarding her with a look
of kindly interest. "You are very young to be
attending to such matters."</p>

<p>"Alas, I have no longer a father," responded
Nadine, her head drooping again, and the big
tears welling up in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, then, your mother&mdash;Why does not she
come?" was the next question.</p>

<p>Poor Nadine's voice almost failed her, and her
answer was scarcely audible:</p>

<p>"I have no mother either."</p>

<p>"What! neither mother nor father!" exclaimed
the lady, throwing up her white hands
with a gesture of astonishment and pity. "Do
you mean to say that you are all alone at your
age?"</p>

<p>Nadine lifted her head again, and a new light
came into her fine eyes. They glowed with both
love and pride as she said:</p>

<p>"No, Madame, I'm not alone. I have two
brothers, and a little sister, but they are all much
younger than I, so I have to look after the business."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">A GOOD FRIEND IN NEED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Madame Prad&#232;re, the Mayor's wife, regarded
Nadine with deep interest. Although she had
much to occupy her time and thoughts that
morning, the situation the young girl had so
simply disclosed was so unusual as to command
her attention to the exclusion of other concerns.</p>

<p>Nadine seemed no less modest and refined than
she was pretty, and her big blue eyes, which contrasted
strangely with her black and curly hair,
bore so sweet an expression that she must manifestly
be something altogether different from the
strolling players with their bold hard looks, rough
voices, and shabby finery, which were wont to
come to the village. Dressed plainly in a black
calico gown, and having a thin black shawl over
her head, she certainly had every appearance of
simplicity and honesty. She was undoubtedly
poor, but her poverty was of that proud kind
which does not seek to inspire pity, but bravely
fends for itself, asking alms of nobody.</p>

<p>"My child," said Madame Prad&#232;re, in a tone so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
full of kindness that Nadine's heart grew warm,
and she felt that the way out of her difficulties
was beginning to open, "the Mayor has not
returned, and may not be back for a while yet;
but however busy he may be he shall spare you a
minute, and if he thinks it all right he'll grant
you the permission you seek. Come with me,"
she added signing to Nadine to follow her. "You
can wait for him in another room, for the kitchen
is in confusion, and you may be in the way of the
servants, who have a great deal to do."</p>

<p>Nadine followed Madame Prad&#232;re into a little
parlor tastefully furnished, where there were ever
so many pretty things that called forth her
admiration.</p>

<p>But she had too much sense to betray any
indiscreet curiosity. Seating herself upon the
chair the mistress of the house indicated, she
made haste to express her gratitude.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Madame, very kind indeed,"
she murmured.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my child, not at all," was the
response. "But now tell me, you seek permission
from the Mayor to stay here a while in order
to sell some little articles I presume?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame. We have nothing to sell,"
replied Nadine, gaining courage from the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
lady's gentle manner. "We are only strolling
performers who give public representations with
our animals."</p>

<p>"Oh! ho! you have animals! Trained dogs,
I suppose, and that sort of thing," and Madame's
comely countenance expressed an amused interest.</p>

<p>"We have only one dog, Vigilant, who is very
comical. He knows how to make the most
morose people laugh when he plays his part with
Nalla." Nadine's eyes brightened at the thought
of her dog.</p>

<p>"Nalla! and pray who is Nalla?"</p>

<p>"Madame," answered Nadine, her face growing
serious again, "Nalla is our breadwinner. He
is the chief attraction of our troupe, for you can
easily understand that such mere children as we
are daren't pretend to be of much account as performers.
In us by ourselves the public would
take very little interest, and we couldn't get along
at all. But when we exhibit Nalla in all the
streets, and make our announcements from his
back, curiosity is aroused, and the people come in
the evening to see our big creature's performance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" exclaimed Madame
Prad&#232;re, looking puzzled. "Your big creature!
Is not Nalla, then, a dog like Vigilant?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried Nadine, smiling, and fully appreciating
the interest she was creating. "Nalla
isn't a dog. Nalla couldn't get into this big
house, Nalla"&mdash;and she paused a moment so as
to emphasize the announcement, "Nalla is an
elephant!"</p>

<p>"An elephant, do you say? Is it possible?
How do you happen to own so costly an animal?
Why, it must be worth a small fortune!" And
as she poured out these questions Madame Prad&#232;re
scrutinized the girl with a certain air of perplexity,
for to her the idea of possessing an
elephant seemed hardly consistent with actual
poverty.</p>

<p>Nadine understood the look, and her pale cheek
flushed slightly.</p>

<p>"I told you, Madame, Nalla is our breadwinner,"
she said with a touch of apology in her
tone. "But he is also more than that. He is
our protector since our father died."</p>

<p>Madame Prad&#232;re's expression at once changed
to one of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Is it long since you lost your parents?" she
asked, adding with a kindly smile: "I may seem
to be very inquisitive, but the fact is you interest
me deeply, and I would like you to tell me your
history. In the first place, what is your name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"Here are my papers, Madame," responded
Nadine, holding out an old portfolio carefully
wrapped up in a bit of silk. "They will tell you
all about me."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said the Mayoress, gently pushing
back the portfolio. "You can show that presently
to my husband, but for myself I prefer to
hear your story from your own lips."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged Nadine proceeded in her own
clear simple way.</p>

<p>"My name is Nadine Tamby. My elder brother
bears the same name as was my father's, C&#230;sar.
The second boy is named Abel, and my little
sister, who is now just six years old, has our
mother's name, Lydia."</p>

<p>At the mention of the name of Lydia Madame
Prad&#232;re's countenance suddenly grew sad, and she
gave a sigh that indicated sorrowful memories.
In truth it had been the name of a little daughter
that once brought joy into her life for a while,
and then was taken from her, leaving a void that
could never be filled.</p>

<p>Nadine meanwhile continued her narration.</p>

<p>"Our mother died four years ago when we were
in the Tyrol, but it is only six months since we
lost our father. He died of consumption after
being sick for a long time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>Nadine's voice sank so low as to be scarcely
audible, and the big tears moistened her cheeks
so that she was fain to wipe them away with her
handkerchief. Her parents had always been good
and kind, and the pain of their loss was still
acute.</p>

<p>"You poor little woman!" murmured Madame
Prad&#232;re, in whose own eyes the tears were glistening,
"and you are the little mother to the others
now."</p>

<p>She was more deeply moved by what she had
heard than she cared to show, and in order to
conceal her emotion she continued to ply Nadine
with questions which the latter answered so clearly
and correctly that the Mayoress could not understand
a young strolling player being so well
educated.</p>

<p>Had she only known the girl's parents she
would not have been so puzzled. C&#230;sar Tamby
and his wife were of respectable descent, and had
always been true to their parentage in spite of
the many temptations to which their mode of life
exposed them. They had brought their children
up with the utmost care possible in view of their
roving life, and during the winter season, when
it was not possible to give their performances,
they had taken pains to teach them quite as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
as they would have learned by attending the
country school, for they were both well educated
themselves.</p>

<p>Thus the Tamby children, although their business
was appearing in public and giving performances
to crowds that too often were by no means
considerate of their feelings, nevertheless remained
honest, simple, and refined in a remarkable
degree.</p>

<p>"And your father," continued Madame Prad&#232;re,
"was he always&mdash;" here she hesitated a
moment, and then finished the sentence with the
polite word&mdash;"an artist?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame," replied Nadine. "His father
was the manager of a circus in which he employed
his five sons, of whom my father was the youngest.
But on the death of my grandfather, and a
series of misfortunes which followed it, the circus
was broken up and everything sold with the exception
of Nalla, and Steady, which fell to my
father."</p>

<p>"Steady!" exclaimed Madame Prad&#232;re. "Who
is that? I know Nalla and Vigilant, but you
haven't mentioned Steady before. Is he a clever
animal like Nalla, or a comic one like Vigilant?"</p>

<p>"He is an animal that is as gentle as a sheep,
and as good as can be," smiled Nadine. "Steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
is an old horse, who was once upon a time quite
a celebrity, but who having become very old, a
little deaf, and somewhat blind, is now fit only to
drag the van, which is our home on wheels. All
the same he is a very true friend, and we love
him dearly for he does us good service. Steady
was given his name by my mother who was an
<i>equestrienne</i>, and who always mounted him with
confidence because his regular movements made
her performance so easy. And now, Madame,"
Nadine concluded with a na&#239;ve smile of apology
for having talked so much, "I've told you about
our whole family."</p>

<p>Just then Madame Prad&#232;re heard the sound of
a carriage rolling into the courtyard. She sprang
up briskly and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"That's the Mayor returning!" she said.
"Wait here a few minutes while I speak to him
about you," and giving the girl an encouraging
smile, she left the room.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, the Mayor, accompanied by
several officers who had been invited to lunch
with him. These were former companions of M.
Prad&#232;re, who had once been a lieutenant in the
army, and had retired upon making a brilliant
marriage, which rendered him independent. So
there were great doings in the chateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Nadine with much concern heard the clinking
of the swords, and the most appetizing smell of
the extra cooking reminded her that the Tamby
children had not yet had any breakfast that day,
while the permission to perform that she had
come to obtain was still in doubt. If it were not
granted there was a poor prospect of food for
either the family or their animals. Oppressed by
these disturbing thoughts she sat there in an attitude
of deep dejection.</p>

<p>She was a young thing to be charged with such
heavy responsibilities, and not a day passed that
she did not keenly feel her youth and weakness.
Yet before the other children her brave spirit
never seemed to flag, or her resolution to falter.
As she had to be both mother and father to them,
she strove gallantly to fill her difficult part to the
very best of her powers, and in truth it was
nothing short of wonderful how well she succeeded.
Still there were times when it seemed
as if her burdens were becoming too heavy to be
longer borne by her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame Prad&#232;re had conducted her
guests into the big dining-room which opened
upon a spacious veranda whence there spread a
broad green lawn reaching to the river's edge.</p>

<p>When all were seated at the table she turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
to her husband with a bewitching smile, and
said:</p>

<p>"Your worship, I have a great favor to ask of
you."</p>

<p>"Madame, that favor is granted in advance of
its being asked," replied her husband with a gallant
bow, and a look of unmistakable pride and
affection, for his wife was a beautiful woman,
and greatly admired by all who knew her.</p>

<p>"And my request applies to Colonel Laurier as
well as to you," continued Madame, fixing her fine
eyes upon the officer, who at once bowed in his
turn, and hastened to say:</p>

<p>"I assure you, Madame, it will give me great
pleasure to do anything you wish."</p>

<p>"I understand, Colonel," Madame went on
after acknowledging his prompt assurance with a
gracious smile, "that your soldiers have taken
complete possession of the market-place."</p>

<p>"They have, Madame," responded the Colonel,
considerably puzzled to guess what she was
driving at. "There are so many of them, you
know, that they require a lot of room."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I quite understand that," said
Madame, her handsome features expressive of a
gay resolution that was immensely becoming.
"But do you know I shall need a part of the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
this evening for a very fine performance, and I
suppose you will be able to make room for the
time."</p>

<p>Colonel Laurier was about to accede at once
when the Mayor broke in hurriedly, and not
altogether politely:</p>

<p>"Those mountebanks again! Have you them
in your mind, my dear? But it is simply out of
the question to-day. I could not think of granting
them permission to perform in the market-place.
You forget that there are two thousand soldiers
there, and that it is my duty to guard against the
occurrence of any trouble."</p>

<p>"That is the very reason I am doing this, your
worship, and why the assistance of Colonel
Laurier and his officers will be so helpful," persisted
Madame, flashing her irresistible smiles
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Pray command us. We are certainly at your
service," responded the officers in chorus.</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">THE TAMBY FAMILY IN PUBLIC.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Having thus prepared the way very skillfully,
Madame Prad&#232;re, radiant at the prosperous
progress of her enterprise, now revealed her
purpose.</p>

<p>"I am very anxious," she said with a charming
glance over all her attentive listeners, "to be
present at the performance this evening, and I
make bold, gentlemen, to beg of you to be present
also. In that way all chance of anything amiss
occurring will be avoided."</p>

<p>"But you do not forget, Madame," put in the
Colonel, "that our being present will mean the
absence of the soldiers, who could not sit with us
without a breach of discipline."</p>

<p>"Oh! that will be all right, I promise you,
Colonel," responded Madame archly. "There'll
be no interference with discipline. The soldiers
will be placed at the back, and in the front there
will be seats reserved for the officers and ourselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Prad&#232;re showed a spirit of irresistible
pleasantry through it all. She was evidently
delighted at having gained the cause of little
Nadine, who was so anxiously awaiting the result
in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," concluded Madame,
"will you permit me to present to you the chief
of my troupe, who is just here, and whom I don't
want to keep waiting any longer?"</p>

<p>"By all means, Madame," responded the
officers. "It will give us much pleasure."</p>

<p>The servant, Fran&#231;oise, was accordingly directed
to bring in Nadine.</p>

<p>"Madame is carried away by these mountebanks,"
growled Fran&#231;oise as she went back to
the kitchen after doing as she had been bid.
"It's enough for these strolling players to have
children to get her interest ever since she lost her
own."</p>

<p>Nadine, blushing and bewildered, stood in the
door of the dining-room where Fran&#231;oise had left
her. The brilliant company of officers, the sumptuous
table decorated with plants and flowers,
and laden with dainties such as she had never in
her life tasted, and the whole richness of the room,
took her breath away, so to speak, and she could
not lift her eyes from the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be dismayed, my child!" said Madame
kindly, quite understanding the cause of Nadine's
confusion. "Come forward, and give your papers
to the Mayor, whom you see there."</p>

<p>Nadine shyly glided up to his worship, and
handed him the papers which she took with great
care out of the old battered portfolio.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that this is the chief of
your troupe, Madame?" asked the Colonel in a
tone that betrayed surprise and skepticism.</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel Laurier," Madame replied with
a smile of amusement. "That child is the eldest
of four, having two brothers and a sister to whom
she has been a little mother for the last six
months, since they became orphans through the
death of their father. She has to attend to all
matters of business besides caring for the little
ones that are really dependent upon her."</p>

<p>"She is certainly very pretty," murmured one
of the captains as he twirled his mustache.
Even if his gracious hostess had not already bespoken
his presence he would certainly have
attended the performance in the evening, for
Nadine was worth a second look.</p>

<p>"Madame," remarked the Colonel with a gesture
that implied he was entirely convinced,
"your prot&#233;g&#233;s are decidedly interesting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
we shall assuredly be delighted to accompany you
to the performance this evening which I am sure
will be most entertaining."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Mayor had been quickly glancing
over the papers which Nadine had handed
him.</p>

<p>"These are all in order," he said with an important
air, "I shall grant the required permission
if you will be good enough, Colonel, to give
orders to your men to make room for these
people."</p>

<p>"That will be done at once," responded Colonel
Laurier, and so, thanks to the intervention of the
kind lady of the house, the whole matter was
satisfactorily arranged.</p>

<p>By this time Nadine had completely regained
her spirits, and, before taking her leave, she said
in a voice that was made all the sweeter by the
deep feeling which its trembling betrayed while
she bent low in a graceful courtesy:</p>

<p>"On behalf of my little sister and brothers,
I thank you, gentlemen, from the bottom of my
heart, and as for myself, I am your most dutiful
servant."</p>

<p>Formal as the words sounded they were manifestly
sincere, but even more heartfelt were those
she added, when, turning toward Madame Prad&#232;re,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
she exclaimed, as she fixed her fine eyes upon
the gracious lady:</p>

<p>"You have been so kind to me, Madame, I
cannot express my thanks," and then she glided
from the room.</p>

<p>The moment she reached the street she set off
at the top of her speed to rejoin the other children.
She knew how impatiently they would be awaiting
her return, particularly as the question of
food for themselves and their animals hung upon
her success.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar was the first to catch sight of her, and
one glimpse of her radiant countenance was
enough to tell him that all was well.</p>

<p>"You have obtained the permission, haven't
you, Nadine?" he cried, so soon as she came within
hearing.</p>

<p>"Yes, C&#230;sar," she panted joyfully. "It's all
right, and we can give a performance this evening,
when we must do our very best, for we are going
to have some important people present;" and
the other two having joined them she proceeded
to tell them all about her good fortune at the
Mayor's house, and the kindness of Madame
Prad&#232;re.</p>

<p>They listened with sparkling eyes and many
exclamations of wonder and delight. Nadine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
certainly had a keenly interested and appreciative
audience.</p>

<p>"And now, C&#230;sar," she concluded, "you must
go to the market and buy some nice fresh hay
for Nalla and Steady."</p>

<p>"But that will take our last cent, and what
about our own food?" protested C&#230;sar, who had
the sharp appetite of a growing boy.</p>

<p>"Oh! we'll just have to wait," replied Nadine
decisively. "But Nalla and Steady must be
attended to."</p>

<p>As she spoke Nalla moved towards his young
mistress, and caressed her with his pliant trunk,
making at the same time a curious deep sound
that somewhat resembled the purring of a giant
cat.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you old dear&mdash;you shan't go hungry
even if we have to for a little while. You're our
good faithful breadwinner, aren't you?" and she
patted the thick soft trunk with her pretty hand.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar grumbled a little, but did as he was bid.
Nadine's rule was as firm as it was gentle, and,
however the others might at times object, she
rarely failed to have her own way in the end.</p>

<p>So the elephant and the horse were soon enjoying
a hearty meal of succulent hay to which they
did full justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>A little later the whole party arrived at the
market-place where they found a place made
ready for them by the orders of Colonel Laurier,
who had not forgotten his promise.</p>

<p>Here Nadine found the gendarme who had
been so civil to her in the morning.</p>

<p>"Young girl," said he courteously, "I am to
show you the place where you can give your performance,
and also to give you Madame Prad&#232;re's
instructions. So first of all tell me how you are
accustomed to set up your outfit."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a very simple affair," responded
Nadine with an apologetic smile. "We have,
you see, our stage," and she pointed to a few
planks and trestles which were hung at the sides
and underneath the van. "But we have to hire
some planks to serve as seats, and these we arrange
in a sort of half-circle leaving plenty of room in
the center for Nalla to go through his performance."</p>

<p>"So, so!" said the gendarme, shaking his
head sagely; "that would be well enough for
other occasions, but this time you will not hire
any planks. There will have to be better arrangements
made, for you are going to be
honored with a very brilliant audience," and he
pursed up his mouth in a most impressive way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
"for whom mere planks would never do at all,
and so for the front rows there must be chairs,
and very good chairs too!"</p>

<p>"But, sir!" cried Nadine, appalled at the idea
of the expense involved in providing such accommodation,
"we can't do that! We have no
money to pay for chairs!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about that, little one," returned
the kindly gendarme, placing his hand
upon her shoulder in a fatherly way. "Leave it
all to me. I have my orders from Madame Prad&#232;re,
and shall see that everything is done just as
she wishes. Unharness your horse, set up your
stage, and let me attend to the rest."</p>

<p>Nadine was puzzled, but the fact that Madame
Prad&#232;re had instructed the old gendarme calmed
her doubts, and she said blithely:</p>

<p>"Very well, sir, I'll do just as you say."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar accordingly unharnessed Steady, and
then, aided by Nadine, proceeded to take from the
van the materials for the stage.</p>

<p>This was always a hard bit of work for their
weak arms, but it was particularly hard on the
days when they had not had any breakfast.
Nevertheless they would go bravely to work with
the help of the intelligent elephant, who would lift
and carry the heavier planks in his powerful trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>To-day, however, they had no lack of helpers,
for, no sooner did the soldiers see what they were
about, than they hastened to offer their assistance,
and in a jiffy the stage was set up instead of
taking many weary minutes.</p>

<p>Just as it was finished a servant-maid carrying
a large basket came up.</p>

<p>"Madame Prad&#232;re sent this to you," she said,
smiling, "she thought you might like something
to eat," and she proceeded to produce from the
basket a liberal supply of tempting food which
she placed upon the stage.</p>

<p>"Truly your mistress is our good angel to-day!"
cried Nadine, the tears of joy and gratitude
brimming her eyes. "I shall not fail to
present to her our thanks before we go away from
here."</p>

<p>This was indeed one of the happiest moments
of their lives. They forgot they had a single care
as they breakfasted heartily upon the tender
chicken, the snow-white bread with plenty of
brown crust, the golden butter, and the rich milk
which their benefactor had provided so thoughtfully.
They had never before enjoyed so delicious
a repast, and Nadine's natural refinement made
her appreciate it all the more because of the
elegance of its appointments, for the dishes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
napery, the knives and forks were from Madame's
own table.</p>

<p>"May the good God bless her a thousand times
and more!" she fervently exclaimed when at last
even C&#230;sar's vigorous appetite was appeased.
"What a treat she has given us all! Come
now, let us put the things neatly back in the
basket. I believe there is enough still left for us
to have for dinner."</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon the Tamby
family with the exception of Nadine, who remained
in charge of their property, after the
manner of performers of their kind, started out
to parade the streets so as to let the people know
of their presence and the entertainment they
proposed to give.</p>

<p>For this purpose a very shabby howdah was
with no little difficulty, on account of its weight,
fixed upon the patient Nalla's back. In this,
little Lydia, with Abel and C&#230;sar, took their
places, trying to look as important as possible.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar had a drum which he beat at intervals,
and whenever there was anybody to listen to him
he would call out the place and time of the approaching
performance. He always enjoyed this
part of the business. He liked being before the
public, and to be perched high up on the elephant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
back, and attracting so much attention was quite
according to his taste.</p>

<p>As for Vigilant, he too had his part to play.
He balanced himself cleverly upon Nalla's broad
neck just in front of the howdah and supported
C&#230;sar's drumming by volleys of shrill barking
which most clearly meant:</p>

<p>"Here we are! Listen to us! Come and
patronize our entertainment! We're well worth
seeing I can tell you!"</p>




<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">A RECORD COLLECTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the parade was over, and it attracted so
much attention that C&#230;sar predicted a bumper
house for the evening, the Tambys made a very
good dinner upon what was still left in Madame
Prad&#232;re's bountiful basket, and then Nadine and
C&#230;sar gave the finishing touches to the arrangements
for the performance.</p>

<p>What the little mountebanks called somewhat
grandly their theater, was really but a few planks
placed upon trestles not more than a yard high.
The stage was about three yards long by as many
deep, and there was a drop-curtain of calico sadly
the worse for wear, while the back was closed in
by a bit of canvas upon which had been painted
some trees with the idea of conveying the notion
of a forest.</p>

<p>It was all pathetically simple and shabby, yet
Nadine somehow managed by dint of her ingenuity,
aided by her excellent taste, to make it look
better than one would imagine, by adding sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
little decorative touches such as only a woman's
hand could bestow.</p>

<p>Half-past seven came, and already not only
small boys but grown-up people also began to
secure their seats upon the planks, the chairs in
front being of course all reserved for Madame
Prad&#232;re and her guests.</p>

<p>A few minutes before eight the soldiers appeared
in great number, and the young Tambys
would have had a difficult job keeping them out
of the reserved seats but for the presence of the
gendarme, who called out at the top of his big
voice:</p>

<p>"You cannot take those chairs. They are reserved
for certain distinguished patrons as you
will soon see. Let me tell you, then, not to sit on
them."</p>

<p>"Oh! we're not deaf. We can hear you all
right," retorted the soldiers, making haste to
settle themselves in the best places that were still
available.</p>

<p>When eight o'clock struck and neither Madame
Prad&#232;re nor the other guests put in an appearance
the spectators commenced to shout:</p>

<p>"Curtain! Curtain!" and to utter shrill cries
of impatience.</p>

<p>It was the soldiers that called out "Curtain!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
after the fashion of the "gods" in the galleries of
the real theaters which they had attended in the
cities.</p>

<p>Nadine and C&#230;sar got very nervous, but they
did not dare to begin before the arrival of Madame
Prad&#232;re.</p>

<p>At this juncture their good friend the gendarme
came to their relief.</p>

<p>"Stupid that I am!" he exclaimed. "Haven't
I forgotten to tell you that Madame, the Mayoress,
will not be here until half-past eight, in time to
hear you sing. You can therefore give the first
part of your performance."</p>

<p>This information removed all their difficulties.
The regulation three knocks were given and the
curtain rose.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar, clothed in a long red gown, and wearing
a hat shaped like a sugar-loaf after the usual
manner of magicians, was revealed standing beside
a table covered with a Turkish table-cloth,
on which were arranged the glasses and double-bottomed
boxes which are indispensable to sleight-of-hand
performers.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar's tricks went off very well indeed, and,
encouraged by the size and hearty interest of the
spectators, he quite eclipsed himself.</p>

<p>There were several hundred gathered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
among them a number of children who were
especially eager to see the different acts in which
Nalla, Steady, and Vigilant appeared.</p>

<p>The soldiers, too, who often behave like a lot
of children, grew impatient, and began to shout
for the animals. They even attempted to imitate
them, one grunting like the elephant, another
neighing like the horse, and the third barking
like the dog.</p>

<p>But the animals were tethered out of sight behind
the van, and did not make their appearance.</p>

<p>When the clamor became too insistent C&#230;sar
came to the front of the stage, and held up his
hand to ask for silence:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said with remarkable
composure for a mere boy. "We are now
about to show you some <i>tableaux vivants</i>. For
these we ask of you complete silence, and a little
patience. The exhibition of the animals will be
given very soon. We will carry out the entire
program as announced, and we beg of you in
return, if you are satisfied with our performance,
to be no less liberal with your money than with
your applause."</p>

<p>This little speech quite took the fancy of the
crowd, who cheered it heartily, and were about to
settle down again to look and listen attentively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
when the sound of approaching carriages made
itself heard.</p>

<p>Nadine's heart leaped for joy. Here at last
were Madame Prad&#232;re and her guests. The performance
would be honored with their presence
after all.</p>

<p>A moment later they appeared, Madame leading
the way, her comely countenance covered with
smiles, and accompanied by several of her lady
friends, while Monsieur Prad&#232;re and a dozen of
the officers followed in her train, among them
being the Colonel, who had thus fulfilled his
promise.</p>

<p>This was a great surprise to the rest of the
spectators, for certainly it had never been known
before that ladies should be present at an open-air
performance by mountebanks, while the soldiers
were not less surprised to see their officers patronizing
such an affair.</p>

<p>This, then, was the explanation of the reserved
seats, and for a brief space the first-comers found
it more interesting than the items on the program.
By so happy a hit the little Tamby family
had advanced wonderfully in the estimation
of the spectators, who said to themselves that in
order to attract such distinguished patrons as the
Prad&#232;res and their friends they must have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
very unusual acts in their repertoire, and no doubt
deserved to be called the little artists.</p>

<p>Nadine at once went forward to bow to Madame
Prad&#232;re, and to thank her for the honor of her
presence, and her kindness to the orphans.</p>

<p>Madame Prad&#232;re made light of that, but went
on to say with an encouraging smile:</p>

<p>"My child, I came especially to hear you sing,
for I believe that you can tell us pretty things
that we do not yet know. So proceed, my little
girl. We are here to listen to you."</p>

<p>Nadine courtesied gracefully, and disappeared
behind the curtain. When the curtain rose again
she was disclosed in the middle of the stage with
her little sister seated near while C&#230;sar stood
ready to accompany her with a mandolin.</p>

<p>A perfect silence fell upon the audience. The
girl looked so pretty and modest that she won all
hearts, and everybody was in the mood to listen
to her with appreciative attention.</p>

<p>She began with a curiously rhythmical prelude,
about which there was at the same time something
sweet, sad, and strange that gripped the
hearts of her hearers. Then in a superb contralto
voice, and with exquisite taste, she broke forth
into song.</p>

<p>As Madame Prad&#232;re had expected, Nadine's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
singing was out of the usual order. She was
telling in song the pitiful story of a mother who
had lost her reason after the death of her only
child.</p>

<p>The poor woman, wandering among the mountains
of Bohemia, confides her grief to the passing
winds, to the echoes murmuring unintelligible
things, to the flowers nodding and smiling in response
to the caresses of the evening breeze.</p>

<p>In her madness she imagines that the soul of
her child has taken refuge in one of the flowers
which bestrew her pathway, and she goes from
one to the other of them repeating her touching
refrain:</p>

<p>"Tell me, O flower! is it you that hides the
soul of my child which was taken away from me
by death?" Then realizing the futility of her
inquiries she breaks out into sudden and terrible
imprecations: "O death, you merciless monster!
Why did you take my child from me?
You are a foul fiend!" and more after the same
fashion.</p>

<p>But presently her mood changes, and, forgetting
her sorrow, she begins to sing to the same
flowers that she had been cursing, in words of infinite
tenderness, such as mothers use to their
darling babes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>When Nadine ceased singing instead of a burst
of applause there was absolute silence. So completely
had she taken possession of her audience
by the pathos and beauty of her song that they
were unwilling to break the spell, and not until
she bowed, and withdrew, did the applause break
forth.</p>

<p>Then it was simply thunderous. From every
side came cries of:</p>

<p>"Bravo! bravo! encore! encore!"</p>

<p>Blushing and smiling and with her heart
throbbing joyously Nadine, looking more charming
than ever, returned, and repeated the last
verse of the song, putting into it such profound
expression and such winning tenderness that
many eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>At this moment Madame Prad&#232;re called little
Lydia to her and said, smiling through the tears
that brimmed her beautiful eyes:</p>

<p>"My pet, you should now take up the collection.
It is just the right time for it. Nadine has
touched the people's hearts and they will not refuse
to put their hands in their pockets. Will
they, Colonel Laurier?" turning to the officer
who sat upon her right.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" he responded warmly, slipping
his own hand into his pocket whence came the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
significant jingle of coin. "This crowd will
give a fine collection I am sure."</p>

<p>"Very well, Madame, I'll run and tell Nadine,"
responded Lydia, bowing prettily, and she darted
off behind the curtain, which rose the next instant
showing C&#230;sar ready to announce the remainder
of the program.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said with quite a
grand air, as if fully appreciating the importance
of what he had to tell them. "We are now to
have the honor of presenting to you the famous
trained elephant Nalla in his wonderful acts of intelligence
and skill. He is the wisest and kindest
elephant in captivity. He understands everything
we say to him, and he can talk a little to
us in his own way. There is no other such elephant
on the continent. We call him our breadwinner
because he is the chief attraction of our
little show. Before he appears Mademoiselle
Lydia will pass amongst you, and will be pleased
to receive whatever you may see fit to give in
return for the amusement we have provided this
evening, and while she is doing this, if you have
no objection, I will play a few tunes upon my
mandolin. If any one present desires a particular
air I shall be very happy to play it if I know
how."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>Having made this clever little speech with exceeding
good grace, C&#230;sar took up his instrument
and in response to the request of one of the officers,
began the solo of the Toreador from "Carmen,"
which he gave with great spirit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nadine accompanied Lydia, who,
holding a wooden bowl in her hand, began the
round of the spectators.</p>

<p>Now on ordinary occasions this was the critical
stage of the performance for the young mountebanks,
as upon what it yielded depended the grave
question of the morrow's bread, and too often,
alas! the results were pitifully meager! Many
a time had poor little Nadine, upon whom the
chief burden of responsibility rested, found it
hard to keep back the tears when, as Lydia set
out with her bowl, the majority of those who had
been watching the performance turned their backs
upon the children who had been doing their best
to amuse them. Ah! yes, many a time had
Nadine, who had learned by experience to gauge
her audience pretty accurately by one glance at
them, felt her heart sink at the critical moment.</p>

<p>But this time nobody slipped away. They all
remained in their places, and seemed eager to
respond to the appeal about to be made.</p>

<p>Nadine first led Lydia up to Madame Prad&#232;re,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
who had called for her that she might be the first
to drop a coin into her bowl.</p>

<p>Lydia, as was her custom, repeated in her
childish quavering voice, the words:</p>

<p>"For the little Tambys, ladies and gentlemen,
a trifle if you please."</p>

<p>But it looked as if she would be more than
taken at her word, for Madame Prad&#232;re set a fine
example by dropping a gold piece into the bowl!</p>

<p>When Nadine saw this the color rose in her
charming face, and she murmured in a voice that
trembled with feeling:</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame, thank you! thank you!"</p>

<p>"Never mind thanks, continue your round,"
laughed Madame Prad&#232;re giving Lydia a gentle
push towards the Colonel. Then, turning to
Nadine, she added: "You have given me a
great deal of pleasure, my sweet one, I assure
you, and we shall want you to sing something
more for us&mdash;another song about a child, if you
can, you can do it with such expression. It goes
right to one's heart."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to do as you desire, Madame,"
responded Nadine, and, with a graceful bow, she
followed Lydia, whose little cries of joy showed
that her mission was proving successful beyond
precedent. In fact she was receiving white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
money&mdash;nothing but white money&mdash;no dark coins
at all. She had never before had such good
fortune, and in her joy she forgot her sister's
admonitions, and danced about exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Another, Nadine, and another! and still another!"</p>

<p>But Nadine did not attempt to restrain her, for
she saw that the people were amused with the
child's artless demonstrations.</p>

<p>When she had been to all the reserved seats,
she turned to the soldiers and workmen who were
in the rear, and none of them failed to put in
a few sous, although, of course, they gave no
silver.</p>

<p>Twice did Lydia empty her bowl into Nadine's
lap. It was the first time the Tamby family had
taken so much at a performance, and their hearts
glowed with joy and gratitude, while the spectators
awaited the second part of the program
with lively interest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">A REMARKABLE FENCER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Amid perfect silence the elephant made his entr&#233;e
under the direction of his little friend Abel,
who could do anything he liked with the good-tempered
monster.</p>

<p>He proceeded calmly to the center of the open
space inclosed by the reserved seats, the planks,
and the standing spectators, and then with trunk
lowered and motionless, stood at attention.</p>

<p>"Nalla!" said Abel, "we shall now pay our
respects to this distinguished gathering."</p>

<p>Then, taking off his toque, he made sweeping
bows to right and left, which the docile elephant
imitated by elevating and lowering his trunk in
a dignified manner that was highly amusing.</p>

<p>"And now, Nalla," continued Abel, who bore
himself with all the importance of a grown person,
"you will be good enough to let us see
how much you know and can do. For instance,
can you sing like your mistress, Mademoiselle
Nadine?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure, I can," responded Nalla, in dumb
show, by lifting his trunk up and down.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," smiled Abel. "Suppose
you give us one of the songs of your own country,
something sweet and tender."</p>

<p>Nalla threw back his enormous ears, and pointing
his trunk high into the air, let forth a series
of horrible sounds that fairly stunned the ears of
the spectators, who nearly rolled over with
laughter while they strove to shut out the dreadful
noise by clapping their hands over their ears.</p>

<p>"That will do! that will do! Nalla!" cried
Abel, giving the absurd creature a slight slap
with his wand. "You sing beautifully, of course,
but you have a shocking bad voice, and you
haven't the least idea of tune. You shall have
to take a course of lessons before you again
appear in public."</p>

<p>"All right!" said the waving trunk, and the
abominable discords ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>"It is evident that you have a very bad cold
to-night, Nalla," said Abel, "and your voice requires
attention. But if you sing so badly, perhaps
you are better at dancing?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I dance admirably," responded
Nalla, proceeding to put himself in position to
begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you be so kind, then, as to show our
kind patrons a quick-step of your own invention?"
asked Abel.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," answered Nalla, but he did
not budge nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter? Why don't you
begin?" demanded Abel, with well-simulated
surprise and anger.</p>

<p>For reply Nalla resumed singing with his huge
horrid voice.</p>

<p>"Ah! I understand," smiled Abel, giving himself
a slap with the wand. "<i>I</i> was forgetting.
You require some one to play for you, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied the mobile trunk, which
expressed its owner's meaning quite as well as
the fingers of deaf-mutes do what they want to
tell.</p>

<p>Turning around, Abel called out:</p>

<p>"Mr. Musician C&#230;sar, will you be so good as to
select from your repertoire something that will
do for the elephant to dance to?"</p>

<p>"I shall be very pleased to do so," responded
C&#230;sar promptly, coming forward with his mandolin.</p>

<p>"Ah, thank you, musician," said Nalla, looking
highly pleased, and, as soon as C&#230;sar struck
up, he began dancing, if not with grace, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
with great earnestness. Indeed the huge creature
kept time with his feet, and circled about in
a way that one could hardly have believed him
capable of doing.</p>

<p>"Excellent! Excellent! Nalla!" exclaimed
Abel, while the spectators showed their concurrence
by a hearty round of applause. "You
certainly are a famous dancer. Now that will
do for the present. You can take a rest."</p>

<p>But, instead of obeying, Nalla continued his
circling, and the waving of his trunk in a very
droll fashion.</p>

<p>"That will do, I tell you," Abel cried. "Stop,
or I'll have to make you!"</p>

<p>Nalla only danced the harder, and was evidently
mocking Abel with that wonderful trunk
which seemed equal to expressing any emotion.
The spectators laughed heartily. The elephant
was more than fulfilling expectations. Indeed
they had never before seen so intelligent and
amiable a monster.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you're driving at," said
Abel, the angry frown on his face yielding to a
smile of comprehension. "You want to fight a
duel. All right! I'm at your service."</p>

<p>Nalla wagged his trunk joyfully, ceased pirouetting,
and took up a position opposite Abel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
who produced two foils with buttons, one of
which he extended to the elephant.</p>

<p>Nalla eagerly seized it with his trunk, and put
himself on guard.</p>

<p>"Ready now!" cried Abel, and at once opened
the attack with great spirit.</p>

<p>But Nalla, dexterously wielding his foil, parried
every thrust to perfection, and Abel could not get
past his guard, try as hard as he might.</p>

<p>The soldiers were highly amused at the lack of
skill shown by the eight-year-old boy, and tried
to be witty at his expense, whereupon Abel
stopped the bout, and, facing the spectators, said
in a tone of challenge:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you are laughing at my failure
and want of experience. No doubt there are
among you many much more expert at fencing
than I am. In that case I shall be only too glad
to make way. Does any one of those present
wish to take my foil, and try a turn with Nalla?"</p>

<p>At first there was no response, and Abel repeated
his request. Then a soldier advanced
slowly.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! there's a champion!" was called
out from the benches.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid in the least," said
Abel encouragingly, for the soldier moved in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
hesitating way. "Fence with Nalla just as you
would with a comrade. He will play you no
mean trick, but I warn you that he's very good
at the game."</p>

<p>The soldier smiled cheerfully, and, grasping
the foil, put himself in position vis-&#224;-vis to the
elephant.</p>

<p>Nalla fixed his bright little eyes upon him, and
with foil in trunk awaited the attack.</p>

<p>Now this soldier who had come forward was a
young fellow of spirit, who was not lending himself
to the little pleasantry in order to show off
his skill at fencing. On the contrary, moved by
the humor of the occasion, he entered the lists
against Nalla quite ready to let the big brute
carry off the honors, and without being troubled
at all as to the figure he should cut himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly he went at the elephant in lively
fashion, but, thrust and feint and dodge as he
might, he could not get inside the clever creature's
guard, or touch any part of his huge body.
Nalla parried every attack with a quickness and
precision that was simply astonishing, evidently
enjoying the play quite as fully as his active
antagonist, who threw himself into it with such
vim.</p>

<p>For a while Nalla contented himself with maintaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
his defense, but presently he changed his
tactics, and assumed the offensive. Without
moving from the spot upon which he stood he
lunged and riposted with such swiftness and accuracy
of aim that he touched the soldier's chest
with the button three times in short order.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!" cried the spectators, delighted
at the big fellow's amazing skill. "Go
for him, old chap! Touch him again."</p>

<p>The soldier, not in the least alarmed, defended
himself gallantly, but it was evident that he was
completely overmatched, and a moment later,
Nalla, as if taking pity on his adversary, by a
clever pass, disarmed him, and then let his own
foil drop.</p>

<p>The place rang with applause while the soldier,
carrying out the play with admirable spirit, assumed
an attitude of profound humiliation.</p>

<p>When the commotion subsided, there were
cries from the soldiers for "Master Deschamps!
Master Deschamps!" and Colonel Laurier turned
around to survey his men with a questioning
look.</p>

<p>Then there came forward a tall athletic man
with a strong dark countenance in which eagerness
and reluctance seemed to be contending.
He was the fencing-master of the regiment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
had the reputation of being one of the most
expert in the whole army. It was, therefore,
only natural that the men should be anxious to
see what he could do against so redoubtable an
opponent.</p>

<p>He approached the Colonel, and by an inquiring
look sought to know the latter's will.</p>

<p>Colonel Laurier glanced at Madame Prad&#232;re,
who in her turn shot a quick look at Nadine.</p>

<p>Nadine smiled back unconcernedly. Madame
Prad&#232;re nodded her assent to the Colonel, and he
said in a low tone to Master Deschamps.</p>

<p>"Try a bout with the creature, but be careful
not to do him any harm."</p>

<p>The fencing-master bowed, and taking the foil
from little Abel put himself on guard.</p>

<p>The excitement was now intense, and the spectators
were perfectly silent. The soldiers expected
great things from their champion, to whom
every trick and strategy of the art of fencing was
known, and the Tamby family were even more
confident concerning their gigantic representative.</p>

<p>The fencing-master went to work very warily
at first. He wanted to learn the extent of his
novel antagonist's skill, and he circled about in
front of him, making dexterous passes and deceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
feints with such rapidity that they could
scarcely be followed by the human eye.</p>

<p>But the little black beads that twinkled in
Nalla's huge head were not to be misled. Wherever
Master Deschamps' foil flashed there was the
elephant's ready to meet it, and the air rang with
the sound of steel striking steel while the spectators
watched the strange struggle breathlessly.</p>

<p>At last the man grew angry. It seemed absurd
to be thus bettered at his own speciality by
a mere animal however big. He darted this way
and that, lunging fiercely, if not recklessly. He
resorted even to devices that were not considered
"good form" in the fencing-hall. But they were
all alike in vain. Nalla, without stirring a foot,
simply by waving his trunk with the foil firmly
held in the end, parried every attack and remained
untouched.</p>

<p>Then Abel whispered to him the single word
"Now," and at once he changed his tactics. Hitherto
he had been on the defense. Now he took
up the attack. The foil fairly whistled through
the air with the rapidity of his movements.
Again and yet again the button touched the
tunic of the fencing-master, not roughly, but
with just sufficient force that there should be no
mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>Despite the discomfiture of their champion
the soldiers broke forth into roars of applause.
Nalla had won their hearts by his superb and
placid dignity. He was the finest beast they had
ever seen, and they did not grudge him his victory.</p>

<p>But Master Deschamps did not take it in
equally good part. He felt bitterly humiliated.
His face grew crimson with rage. His eyes
glowed like burning coals, and at last forgetting
himself in his fury he gave an inarticulate hoarse
cry, and rushed at the elephant brandishing his
foil with the evident intention of using it, not in
the proper way, but as a whip wherewith to
smite his successful antagonist.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">THE ANIMALS DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nadine screamed and darted forward. Madame
Prad&#232;re shrieked and rose from her chair.
The Colonel sprang to his feet, and shouted:
"Master Deschamps&mdash;Halt!" in his most commanding
tone.</p>

<p>They were all concerned for the elephant, who
was thus threatened with cruel blows from the
shining steel. But their anxiety was after all
unfounded. Nalla, perfectly alive to the impending
danger, stood motionless until the fencing-master
was within range of that marvelous trunk,
and then there was one movement of the sinuous
powerful thing, the sharp swish of steel cutting
the air, and the baffled soldier's foil, torn from
his grasp, went flying through the air into the
darkness behind the van.</p>

<p>There was one moment of amazed silence, and
then burst forth a tumult of applause to which
all previous ones were as nothing. The special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
guests were delighted at the astonishing adroitness
of Nalla, while the soldiers, not failing to
appreciate it, were even more delighted at the
discomfiture of Master Deschamps, who was a
merciless martinet that often made their lives
miserable.</p>

<p>As for the fencing-master&mdash;he seemed so utterly
chagrined, and slunk away looking so cast down,
that Colonel Laurier considered he was sufficiently
punished, and let him go unrebuked.</p>

<p>After this excitement it seemed appropriate to
have the soothing influence of a song, and accordingly
C&#230;sar announced amid general approval
that Nadine would now fulfill her promise of
singing again.</p>

<p>The little woman, her pretty countenance
wreathed in smiles, for this wonderful evening
had made her heart lighter than it had been
for many a day, then came forward, and C&#230;sar
being ready with his mandolin, began a lovely
cradle-song with a curious penetrating charm.</p>

<p>The spectators were greatly pleased with it,
and if Nadine had been guided by the successive
waves of applause, she would have sung again
and again. But the hour was getting late, and
there still remained to be given the grand act in
which all the animals took part, and which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
being anticipated with the keenest interest by the
younger portion of the assembly.</p>

<p>First of all, the dog, Vigilant, with the cap of a
mousquetaire upon his head, and a neat pair of
boots upon his hind paws, made his appearance
mounted upon Steady, looking very happy and
important. He had, attached to his right paw, a
tiny whip with which in a very comical way he
flipped his steed from time to time as if he was
impatient for the sedate old animal to quicken
his pace.</p>

<p>But Steady took not the slightest notice of
these attentions from his rider. He came in with
a slow chump-chump-chump, his head hanging
between his fore-legs, and his whole appearance
that of a horse thoroughly tired out, while Vigilant
ran up and down his back from neck to
tail and back again, his rapid barks expressing
alternately coaxing and scolding, persuasion and
abuse.</p>

<p>Yet all without avail. Steady remained equally
deaf to threats as to entreaties. He positively
make one ache with sympathy to look at him, so
perfectly did the clever beast enact extreme
weariness.</p>

<p>Presently Steady sank upon his knees, and,
after resting in that attitude a moment, made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
great effort to regain his feet, but seeming unable
to do it, fell over on his side, and, stretching out
his head, lay upon the ground as limp and motionless
as though he were dead.</p>

<p>At once Vigilant, being thus sent to the ground
much against his will, sent up a most piteous
bewailing so far as it could be expressed through
the medium of barking. He went to Steady's
head and barked right into his ears to make him
understand the better. But all to no purpose.
Steady did not budge.</p>

<p>Then Vigilant got angry, and he circled around
Steady pouring upon him a shower of blows from
his whip. These having no effect, he stopped as
if at last realizing that his steed was dead, and,
squatting down on his hind legs, began to cry,
and to wipe away the tears with his left paw in
an exceedingly funny way.</p>

<p>Suddenly he lifted his head and pricked up his
ears. He heard the voice of a child singing
softly. With an eager volley of barks he called
for assistance. Whereupon Nalla appeared upon
the scene with Lydia perched upon his broad
neck.</p>

<p>"Did you call me, young sir?" asked Lydia
precisely as if she were addressing one of her own
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;" yapped Vigilant excitedly.</p>

<p>"And what can I do for you?" inquired Lydia
with a sympathetic smile.</p>

<p>Vigilant did his best to explain. He pointed
with his paw to Steady lying prone upon the
ground, apparently dead, and with the most
touching little barks he strove to make his
meaning clear.</p>

<p>Lydia looked as if she understood what he was
driving at, but said in a guileless way:</p>

<p>"Young sir, I am only a child, and my education
is far from complete. I can, it is true, speak
several languages, but I know nothing of the
one you use. However, I think that with a little
patience it will be possible for us to understand
each other. Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly!" responded Vigilant, bowing
neatly.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," continued Lydia. "As you
understand me, we shall proceed. I shall ask you
some questions, and you will answer me, one
bark being for 'yes,' and two for 'no.' You
catch that? All right. Have you come a long
way? Yes. You are, then, perhaps some young
prince making a tour of the country?"</p>

<p>"That's it," replied Vigilant.</p>

<div class="figcenter newpage">
  <img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="511" height="800" alt="Dog" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap">"Alas, I do!" answered the Dog.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Very good! You're a young prince, I've no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
doubt," said Lydia, "judging from your distinguished
manners, and the elegance of your
speech. But this horse that is lying down there,
does he belong to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," responded the dog emphatically.</p>

<p>"He is tired or sick, perhaps," continued Lydia
in a tone of sympathy, "and you cannot continue
your journey, eh?"</p>

<p>At this Vigilant made shift to weep, and to
cross his paws over his heart in a most beseeching
manner.</p>

<p>"Your distress is very touching, young sir,"
said the child. "You think your horse is
dead?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I do!" answered the dog in a long
pitiful whine.</p>

<p>"It is indeed very unfortunate that a young
gentleman of your quality should find himself in
this predicament in such a lonely place," pursued
Lydia. "Your parents are no doubt anxiously
awaiting your return?"</p>

<p>"You've just hit it! You're quite right," the
eager barking seemed to reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! I understand," went on Lydia, her
face brightening with a sudden gleam of comprehension.
"You have perhaps disobeyed your
mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have," Vigilant confessed with a very
penitent air.</p>

<p>"Then you are being punished for your misbehavior,"
rejoined Lydia with the air of a
grandmother. "So much the worse for you.
You've been naughty, and you must take the
consequences. I can't do anything for you, young
sir. Good-luck and good-bye to you. Come,
Nalla, we must go on our way."</p>

<p>But Nalla did not stir, and began to make
certain mutterings as though he were begging
Lydia for something.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Nalla?" demanded Lydia.
"Do you wish to give some assistance to this
young man?"</p>

<p>The elephant's trunk gave an emphatic answer
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Yes," it seemed to say. "I do, because it
would be a kindness."</p>

<p>"To be sure! I was forgetting your power,"
returned Lydia, adding as she turned to Vigilant,
"You are fortunate, young sir, that Nalla came
your way, for you must know that having been
brought up in a temple, Nalla, when he was
young, received from the god Buddha the power
of doing three times in his life whatever good
action he might see fit, even though it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
bringing a horse back to life, and Nalla now is
going to revive your poor old horse."</p>

<p>On hearing this Vigilant poured forth a volley
of joyful barks, and started dancing around in a
way that Lydia called waltzing.</p>

<p>Then Nalla, having lifted Lydia to the ground
with his wonderful trunk which served so many
useful purposes, approached Steady, whom he
touched gently with his trunk, and, directed by
Lydia, walked three times around him, waving
his trunk in a curious spiral fashion. Next,
thrusting it under the motionless horse, he endeavored
to lift him to his feet, but the moment
he offered to take away the support the poor
beast threatened to fall down again.</p>

<p>Vigilant now saw that he must come to Nalla's
aid, and he made haste to pile up the dust with
his paws under each of the horse's feet as the
clowns do in the circus in their own ridiculous
fashion.</p>

<p>This proceeding evoked a roar of laughter from
the highly amused spectators, and when it was
finished Nalla let out a tremendous trumpeting,
fit to rouse the world. It was effectual in rousing
Steady at all events, and, with a shake that
seemed to make his bones rattle, he stood up
straight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>Vigilant was most profuse in his gratitude,
making profound bows, accompanied by graceful
salutes with the little whip fastened to his paw.</p>

<p>Lydia again bid him "Good-day," and Nalla
putting out his trunk for her, regained her place
upon his broad back.</p>

<p>As they were departing, Vigilant called them
back. It was all well enough to bring his steed
back to life, and set him upon his feet again, but
now that he had dismounted he was quite unable
to remount without assistance.</p>

<p>"Sure enough!" smiled Lydia in response to
his excited request. "I might have thought of
that. Nalla will be happy to do you that slight
service, won't you, Nalla?"</p>

<p>Nalla waved his trunk in token of assent, and
then extended it towards Vigilant. The dog
kept perfectly still while the wonderful appendage
that could do almost anything, picked him
up in the most careful manner, and deposited him
upon the back of the horse.</p>

<p>Then the whole party withdrew, and the next
moment Lydia reappeared to proceed with her
song. But the other actors in the little scene
were in such high spirits that they could not permit
her to have the singing to herself.</p>

<p>First, Vigilant lifted up his voice with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
energy. Then Steady, to whom Lydia had given
a lump of sugar, whinnied his satisfaction in an
insistent fashion, and finally Nalla joined in with
his deafening and by no means melodious trumpeting,
swinging his huge head from side to
side, and completing a quartet, whose music,
while it stunned the ears of the audience, was
certainly ridiculous enough to make the most
morose smile, and win a laugh from the most
dignified.</p>

<p>This concluded the entertainment, and the
spectators, thoroughly well pleased with what
they had seen and heard, began to disperse. Madame
Prad&#232;re went forward to congratulate
Nadine, and to invite her and Lydia to come and
see her next morning before they left for another
place. The Mayor and the Colonel also signified
the pleasure the performance had given them,
and in a little while the whole gathering had
vanished.</p>

<p>When they were by themselves in their van the
young Tambys made haste to reckon up the receipts
of the evening with beaming countenances.</p>

<p>"It can't be so much, Nadine!" cried C&#230;sar
on his sister announcing the total. "You are
surely mistaken!"</p>

<p>"Well, let us go over it again, C&#230;sar," rejoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Nadine with a happy smile, and accordingly the
white and brown coins, among which kind Madame
Prad&#232;re's gold piece glittered conspicuously,
were once more carefully counted.</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty-eight francs!" exclaimed
C&#230;sar, springing to his feet, and waving
his cap joyously. "Just think of it! We never
had so much money of our own before! And to
get it all in one evening! Oh! that kind good
Madame, and the polite Colonel, it was because
of them we did so well. We owe it to them,
don't we, Nadine?" and in the ecstasy of his delight
he threw his arms around his pretty sister's
neck, and kissed her warmly.</p>

<p>Nadine blushed with pleasure at this rare
tribute of brotherly affection.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, C&#230;sar," she responded. "Madame
Prad&#232;re is certainly our good angel, and we
shall all go to thank her again before we leave
here. Oh! if only our dear father were still
alive, how glad he would be! We never made
so much at one performance when he was with
us," and at the recollection of her father the
young girl's fine eyes filled with tears, and her
rosy lips quivered.</p>

<p>But, controlling her grief, she smiled brightly
through her tears as she added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall all have plenty to eat for a good
while now, and Nalla, and Steady, and Vigilant
will grow fat again. Come now, let us all get to
bed. We're tired out, and there'll be plenty to do
in the morning."</p>

<p>So in quick time the van was by a few simple
changes converted into a sleeping-apartment, and
after C&#230;sar had seen to it that the animals lacked
for nothing, the light-hearted quartet of children,
having committed themselves to the care of the
good God, whom their parents had taught them
to love, lay down to sleep, little imagining how
rudely their much-needed rest was ere long to
be disturbed.</p>




<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">THE STAMPEDING OF NALLA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was drawing near to midnight. The market-place
was wrapped in darkness and silence. The
Tamby family children inside the van were dreaming
pleasantly of fresh successes, while close by
Nalla and Steady dozed comfortably after the
labors of the day, and the excitement of the
evening.</p>

<p>The gendarme, whose duty it was to patrol the
market-place, and who had been one of the most
appreciative spectators of the performance, after
making a few turns of the square, and assuring
himself that things were all right, sat down upon
some hay in a corner, and before he knew what
he was about fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>A few minutes later two dark forms glided
stealthily out from an alley, and crept towards
the Tambys' van. That their presence meant no
good, the method of their approach clearly indicated,
but who were they, and upon what mischief
were they bent?</p>

<p>To answer this question it must be explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
that in the town was an academy which had many
pupils, and of these a number had attended the
performance. On their return to the academy
they got into a lively discussion about the animals,
and Nalla, of course, was the chief subject.</p>

<p>One of the elder boys, who really was well informed
for his age, and liked to make a show of
his learning, asserted that in spite of their size
elephants were great cowards, and were terrified
at the sight of a mouse.</p>

<p>The other boys laughed at this statement.</p>

<p>"A great big elephant afraid of a tiny mouse!"
they cried. "Fudge! you don't know what you're
talking about!"</p>

<p>This angered Raoul, and the controversy waxed
warm until finally, carried away by excitement,
he shouted:</p>

<p>"Look here now, fellows, I do know what I'm
talking about, and if any of you will get me a
mouse I'll prove it."</p>

<p>A chorus of derisive laughter greeted this challenge,
which angered Raoul still more, and he
fairly screamed out:</p>

<p>"Get me a mouse, and I'll show you that I'm
right!"</p>

<p>"A mouse! a mouse! who knows where to get
a mouse?" called out one of the senior boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
looking around as though he expected some one
to produce the tiny animal from his pocket.</p>

<p>"I do," responded a little fellow with a sharp
thin face that gave him somewhat the appearance
of a mouse himself. "I have three of them in a
box. I keep them as pets."</p>

<p>At this announcement there was a shout of
satisfaction, and the youngster was bidden to
bring out his curious pets.</p>

<p>He ran off, and presently returned with a little
pasteboard box in which some live thing could be
heard moving.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the others with the exception
of Raoul, who looked decidedly disconcerted.
"Now we are all right. We have the mouse, and
Raoul will show us how he can frighten the big
elephant."</p>

<p>To judge by Raoul's expression he would greatly
prefer going off quietly to bed, but he was in for
it now, and must at least make an effort to carry
the thing through.</p>

<p>So, summoning his resolution, he assumed a
jaunty air, and said, gayly:</p>

<p>"Come along then. We'll see if I'm not right."
And he led the way followed by as many boys as
dared risk the consequences of being away from
the school at night without leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>They slipped out of the building silently, and
directed their steps to the market-place. Here,
Raoul, who was of course in command, ordered
all but one to remain hidden in an empty stall,
while he and his chum went over to the van.</p>

<p>They moved as noiselessly as shadows, and
when they reached there, the Tamby children and
the animals were wrapped in profound slumber.
Not even Vigilant scented their approach.</p>

<p>Trembling all over with nervousness, their
hearts beating like trip-hammers, and their
mouths parched as with great thirst, the two
boys crept near to Nalla, who stood beside the van
as motionless as if carved out of stone.</p>

<p>With shaking fingers they opened the little
box, and, seizing its tiny occupant, threw it at the
sleeping monster.</p>

<p>The mouse struck Nalla full upon the trunk,
and then dropped at his feet, stunned by the cruel
blow.</p>

<p>In an instant the great creature was awake,
and the tip of his trunk touched the furry morsel
on the ground, which squeaked and struggled
piteously.</p>

<p>The effect upon the elephant was appalling.
A violent convulsion shook his mighty frame.
He broke forth into terrible trumpetings, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
snapping his tether as though it had been only
a thread, he dashed off at full speed into the
darkness, flying panic-stricken from what had
terrified him.</p>

<p>Immediately wild confusion succeeded the quiet
which had reigned. Vigilant set up a frantic
barking, and Steady joined in with an anxious
whinnying. The Tambys started from their
sleep, and rushed out of the van in their nightdresses
screaming with fright; the gendarme,
aroused from his pleasant dozing in the hay,
sought to cover his lapse of duty by rattling his
sword, and shouting fiercely:</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What means all this
row? I demand to know at once."</p>

<p>But there was at first no one to answer him.
The mischievous boys and Nalla had disappeared,
and they alone knew what had taken place.</p>

<p>Presently Nadine recovered her wits, and at
once realized the situation.</p>

<p>"Nalla has been frightened," she cried, "and
has run off. Oh! how shall we get him back?"</p>

<p>"Why, he'll come back himself when he gets
over his scare," responded C&#230;sar, doing his best
to be cheerful. "If not, we'll find him in the
morning all right."</p>

<p>But Nadine was not to be easily comforted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Nalla's frantic trumpeting had filled her heart
with terror, and this combined with the sudden
awakening from sleep, had completely unnerved
her. She burst into tears, and wrung her hands
as she sobbed out:</p>

<p>"Poor Nalla! what will happen to him? He'll
be sure to get hurt. Oh! Isn't it dreadful!"</p>

<p>Her distress certainly had good grounds. A
huge creature, mad with terror, charging wildly
through the streets of the town, and perhaps out
into the country, could hardly fail to do injury to
himself if not to others.</p>

<p>By the time the matter was made clear to the
dull-witted though well-intentioned gendarme, a
number of the soldiers had come over from their
side of the market-place to offer their services if
they could be of any use.</p>

<p>An excited consultation followed in which
several voices were always trying to make themselves
heard simultaneously, and there did not
seem much hope of any practical issue until one
of the officers put in an appearance, and he at
once assumed the direction of affairs.</p>

<p>He questioned the tearful Nadine and the
troubled C&#230;sar about Nalla and his habits, and
on learning how kind and faithful a creature he
was, he strove to reassure them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"Make your minds easy," he said in a tone of
superior knowledge. "Nothing dreadful will
happen. The elephant will run until he is tired,
and then he will find some nice fresh herbage,
and he will stop to feed upon it. It would be no
use trying to find him to-night, but immediately
after reveille in the morning I will put at your
services a detail of soldiers, and they will go out
to look for your elephant."</p>

<p>Nadine and C&#230;sar thanked him warmly. He
was quite right after all. It would be useless
searching for Nalla in the darkness. They must
wait for daylight, and so they bade everybody
"Good-night" and went back into their van to
wait for the morning.</p>

<p>The two younger children soon fell asleep again,
but not so did Nadine and C&#230;sar. They spent
the long hours whispering to each other conjectures
as to what could possibly have so frightened
Nalla, and exchanging hopes of how soon he
would be found again.</p>

<p>At dawn they were ready and watching impatiently
for the soldiers. The officer proved
even better than his promise, for having reported
the affair to Colonel Laurier, the latter had in the
goodness of his heart, ordered out fifty soldiers
with the command that they were to continue the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
search until the elephant had been found and
returned to its owners.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the officer, who was a
particularly quick-witted young man, four parties
were formed and one of the children accompanied
each, the shrewd idea being that whichever party
located Nalla there would be with it one that
the great creature loved and trusted, and whose
orders he would obey.</p>

<p>The plan of campaign having been thus skillfully
arranged, the four parties set off upon their
quest, going north, south, east, and west from
the market-place.</p>

<p>All this kindness was not without its cheering
influence upon the Tambys, who quite recovered
their spirits, and high with hope of nothing serious
having happened to their breadwinner, bade
each other good-luck as the parties separated.</p>

<p>It not being possible even for a story-writer to
be in four places at the same time, only Nadine's
party will be followed.</p>

<p>They steered due north, making inquiries of
every one they met upon the route. At first the
answers returned gave them no encouragement
that they were in the right direction. But after
they had cleared the town and got into the outskirts,
they began to hear of some strange enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
thing that had been caught sight of as it
sped along the road. Those who first glimpsed it
had not fully believed their senses, and supposed
themselves to be the object of some delusion.
Farther on, however, their informants had had
more light to see by, and were able to give a
better account, until presently they received so
accurate a description of the marvel that they
knew they were hot upon the scent.</p>

<p>"We shall come up with him soon now," said
the officer confidently to Nadine. "He wouldn't
run far after he got tired, and he'd be sure to
look out for something to eat."</p>

<p>They kept on at good speed, plying every one
with questions, and getting such full replies as
to the startling size and aspect of the creature
that they expected to have his huge gray shape
loom into sight at any moment.</p>

<p>Finally they came to a prosperous farm among
the outbuildings of which something very exciting
was evidently transpiring, as the folks were
hurrying thither breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Nalla's there!" cried Nadine, clutching the
officer's arm in her anxiety. "I hope they're not
hurting him. Oh! come, let us be quick and get
to him."</p>

<p>"Hurting him!" laughed the officer. "Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
much fear of that! He can take care of himself.
I'm more concerned about his hurting some of
them. Come along!" and catching the girl's
hand he broke into a run.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">NALLA RECOVERED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>They made their way around the rear of the
barn, and then one glance was sufficient to explain
the excitement. Before them stretched an
extensive market-garden, displaying a splendid
variety of vegetables in full growth; cabbages,
cauliflowers, beets, carrots, radishes, celery, and
so forth, covered the well-weeded soil with their
succulent verdure.</p>

<p>The sagacious elephant had not taken long to
appreciate the opportunity upon which he had
come by the mere chance of his frantic flight.
The tempting green things had appealed at once
to him, and he was busy sampling the different
delicacies, pulling them from the ground with
that wonderful trunk of his quite as deftly as the
proprietor or his servants could have done it with
their hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the latter, armed with pitchforks,
rakes, brooms, and other rural implements,
were keeping a respectful distance as they shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and waved their weapons at the voracious intruder,
who proceeded with his feast as steadily
and calmly as if he neither saw nor heard them.</p>

<p>The officer broke into laughter in which Nadine,
relieved beyond expression at the sight of her
precious elephant, not only unharmed, but enjoying
himself so hugely, could not resist joining.</p>

<p>"Just look at the clever old fellow!" chuckled
the officer. "Isn't he having a fine time of it?
It seems a pity to disturb him."</p>

<p>"Oh! but he will do so much damage, and we
will have to pay for it!" cried Nadine, who had
always, poor girl, to consider the financial side of
things, for was she not the little mother of a
family that had many needs?</p>

<p>"That's so!" responded the officer, making a
grimace. "There'll be a bill for damages, I suppose.
Let us go to him and get him to stop his
blow-out at once."</p>

<p>Nadine's appearance was not noticed by the
rustics until she went right up to the elephant,
and seized his trunk, saying:</p>

<p>"You naughty Nalla! you mustn't do that!
You're stealing these vegetables, and I'll have to
pay the farmer for them."</p>

<p>To the amazement of all save the officer, the
elephant at once stopped his eager feeding, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
forth a joyful trumpeting, passed his trunk affectionately
over Nadine's face, and then, wrapping
it about her body, lifted her slight form to his
neck, where he deposited her as gently as a mother
would her baby.</p>

<p>From her commanding position Nadine made
haste to address the open-mouthed rustics.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, my Nalla," she said, patting
the huge head with a certain air of reproof that
the intelligent creature really seemed to understand,
"has given you such a scare, and eaten so
many of your vegetables. But something frightened
him last night on the market-place, and he
ran away, and we have been hunting for him
ever since dawn. I will pay the owner of the
garden for the damage he has done."</p>

<p>The murmur of astonishment changed into one
of applause. There are no people with a livelier
appreciation of dash and daring than the French,
and Nadine's dramatic appearance on the scene,
and remarkable self-possession for so young a
girl, made a profound impression.</p>

<p>One of the men cried out, "Bravo! Bravo!"
and the others joined in, their hitherto frightened
faces beaming with relief and interest.</p>

<p>The quick-witted officer saw the chance of
getting Nadine out of the difficulty without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
cost; stepping forward and making a gesture to
command attention, he said:</p>

<p>"It is true that the elephant has done a certain
amount of damage here, for which his young
mistress is quite willing to pay if the proprietor
of the garden insists; but it has occurred to me
that you might like to have the big fellow pay
the bill himself, by showing you how clever he
is, and how he understands every word that his
mistress says to him."</p>

<p>This proposition was received with an instant
chorus of approval, and the proprietor, a good-natured
prosperous man, who had by this time
completely got over both his fright and his indignation,
having graciously signified his assent,
the officer turned to Nadine and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Mademoiselle, will you be kind enough
to show these good people what a very wise and
intelligent animal your elephant is?"</p>

<p>Nadine, smiling radiantly, for her young heart
had been sorely troubled at the prospect of having
to pay, she had no idea how much, for what
Nalla had destroyed or eaten, at once proceeded
to put the great creature through his repertoire
of tricks.</p>

<p>He bowed, he danced, he sang, he picked up the
tiniest objects with his trunk, he responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
"yes" or "no," most appropriately to her questions,
and altogether so delighted the country-folk
that they were loath to let him leave
them.</p>

<p>But of course Nadine, so soon as her mind
was relieved, bethought herself of C&#230;sar, and
Abel, and Lydia, and was impatient for them
to be spared further anxiety. So as soon as it
could be managed she took her departure, having
thanked the proprietor very prettily for his
leniency.</p>

<p>She rode on Nalla's neck back to the market-place,
and her return was somewhat in the nature
of a triumph, for the others had all got back with
nothing to report, and were consequently in very
low spirits, and when she appeared mounted upon
the missing animal they shouted and screamed
for joy, while the crowd that had gathered out of
curiosity vigorously applauded.</p>

<p>They had just got over their demonstrations,
and were setting about preparations to make a
move from the town towards the next halting-place,
when the gendarme bustled up to say that
the secret of the elephant's stampede had been
discovered, and that Nadine's presence was required
at the Sous-Pr&#233;fet's office.</p>

<p>"You will please come with me, Mademoiselle,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
puffed the fat old fellow. "I will be your escort,
and you shall have the satisfaction of seeing the
rascals who played such a mean trick upon you
properly punished."</p>

<p>Nadine, dear little soul, was so happy at the
affair having terminated without any ill consequences,
that she had not the slightest desire for
vengeance upon the perpetrators of the mischief,
and would fain have let the matter rest. But of
course a summons from the Pr&#233;fet could not be
disregarded, so, leaving to C&#230;sar the packing-up,
she accompanied the gendarme.</p>

<p>In the Mayor's office she found a number of
people, and among them three very miserable
looking schoolboys, who were presently subjected
to a sharp examination.</p>

<p>It seemed that the absence of the boys from the
school had been detected by one of the teachers,
who set himself to discover what it meant, and
by clever investigation had got to the bottom of
the affair, whereupon, not knowing how serious
the outcome might be, he had reported it to the
authorities.</p>

<p>Raoul and two others were accordingly haled
to the Pr&#233;fet's office for a sort of preliminary
examination, and Nadine was called upon to be
prosecutor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>Instead, however, of presenting her complaint,
she put in an earnest plea for the culprits, who
were much about her own age.</p>

<p>"Please, your Honor, I don't want them to be
punished. Nalla is not a bit the worse for his
fright. Indeed," she added na&#239;vely, "he is the
better for it by such a fine breakfast of vegetables
as he has not had for a long time."</p>

<p>A ripple of laughter ran around the crowd at
this charming little speech, and the Pr&#233;fet with
a gallant bow to Nadine, said, graciously:</p>

<p>"You make a very good advocate, Mademoiselle,
and as you do not want to appear as prosecutor
in the matter I will dismiss the accused,
and let the authorities of the school deal with
them as they see fit for the infraction of discipline.
Permit me to congratulate you upon the
fortunate termination of the accident."</p>

<p>Raoul and his companions regarded Nadine
with looks in which gratitude and admiration
were manifestly mingled. They had come to the
Pr&#233;fet's office in fear and trembling, and they
would, of course, be well punished by the head of
the school as it was, but the dismissal by the
Pr&#233;fet without any penalty was an altogether
unlooked for peace of luck, which they owed in
large measure to the very person who had most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
reason to find satisfaction in their being condignly
punished.</p>

<p>Nor did Nadine's magnanimity go without reward.
The whole affair served as the best kind
of advertisement, and the demand on the part of
those who had not been present at the first performance,
to be given the opportunity to attend
another, was so urgent that she wisely changed
her plan of leaving the town that day.</p>

<p>"We shall not, of course, get anything like so
splendid a collection as we did last night, because
good Madame Prad&#232;re and the kind officers will
not be there again; but we shall most probably
get a good deal more than we usually do, and so
it will be worth our while to stay over one more
night."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar quite concurred in the wisdom of this
proposal, and accordingly the preparations for a
move were stopped, and in their place they began
arrangements for the evening.</p>

<p>The sequel fully sustained the shrewdness of
the young girl's forecast. The Tamby family,
their youth, their brave independence, their wonderfully
trained animals, the interest taken in
them by the Mayor and his good wife, and the
shabby trick which had been played upon them
by some of the pupils at the academy, were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
talk of the town, and long before the hour announced
for the beginning of the performance the
plank seats were bending beneath their load of
humanity, while behind and around them the
crowd was packed as close as possible.</p>

<p>The whole program of the preceding evening,
with some additions, was given without a hitch.
Nalla, Steady, and Vigilant played their several
parts to perfection, and the spectators applauded
contentedly.</p>

<p>When it came to the collection the response was
not quite so generous as at the first performance.
There was no Madame Prad&#232;re to lead off with
a gold piece, and no officers to emulate her with
silver coins.</p>

<p>But there were some "white pieces" nevertheless,
and a great number of "brown pieces,"
so that altogether the Tambys felt well repaid for
their evening's work.</p>

<p>The following morning Nadine, taking Lydia
with her, went to pay her respects to Madame
Prad&#232;re, and to thank her for her great kindness.
On the way she met the good-natured
gendarme, who let her into the secret of Madame
Prad&#232;re's interest in them.</p>

<p>"You must know," said the genial old fellow,
"that Madame Prad&#232;re has suffered a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
affliction. She once had four children, two boys
and two girls, just as there are in your family,
and the youngest of them was, strange to say,
named Lydia, and, sad to tell, she lost all four of
them within two years!"</p>

<p>Nadine's eyes filled with tears, and her heart
thrilled with sympathy for her benefactress when
she heard this.</p>

<p>"The poor lady!" she murmured. "I am so
sorry for her, and she is so kind."</p>

<p>Madame Prad&#232;re received the two girls cordially,
and asked them how they were getting on,
and what were their plans for the future.</p>

<p>As they were taking their leave, she handed
Nadine a sealed envelope, saying:</p>

<p>"Keep this in a safe place, and do not open it
unless you are in great need. Remember me,
my dear child; I will always be your friend."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">NALLA TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Tambys' intention was to proceed to the
fair at Beaulieu, where mountebanks usually did
well, and as it would open in three weeks, and it
would take them quite twenty days to get there
with so old and weak a horse as Steady, they had
little time to lose.</p>

<p>They set off in the forenoon, all four of them
deeply regretting that they must leave this place,
where they had found so many kind friends, and
once more make their way amongst strangers,
the most of whom took no interest in them whatever.</p>

<p><i>En route</i> to Beaulieu they halted frequently to
give performances, with varying success. Sometimes
the receipts would hardly be enough to buy
food for the animals, and sometimes more than
sufficient to provide for them all.</p>

<p>"It is certainly fortunate that we did get such
a fine collection at Morainville," said Nadine one
night, when a mere handful of small dirty copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
coins was all they received for a very tiring performance
after a long day's travel, "or I don't
know what we should do now. I am using as
little of it as I possibly can, but it is getting less
and less all the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, sister!" responded C&#230;sar,
who was of a very hopeful disposition, and did
not worry like Nadine, not feeling the same
sense of responsibility; "we'll make plenty of
money at the fair, see if we don't."</p>

<p>"I hope we will, I'm sure," returned Nadine,
letting the anxious look drop from her pretty
features; "for you see the summer is coming to
an end and the winter will be at hand before very
long, and we must have a good deal saved up to
carry us through that."</p>

<p>"And we will have it, dear Nadine," cried
C&#230;sar confidently, giving her a brotherly hug,
and a smacking kiss that brought the blushes to
her cheeks. "Never fear about that. The good
God will take care of us," and off he went whistling
merrily, Nadine following him with as much
love and pride in her look as though she were his
mother.</p>

<p>He was really a fine chap, C&#230;sar&mdash;brave, bright,
manly, unselfish, and devoted to his sisters and
little brother. Not as shrewd and far-seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
as Nadine, but clever enough in his way, and
certain to get on in the world, if given a fair
chance.</p>

<p>Their worst experience was at Malaventure, a
town that had grown up beside a large colliery,
whose miners formed the bulk of the inhabitants.
Nadine, with her remarkable intuition, had some
misgivings about performing there, because the
place had rather a bad reputation for rowdyism,
the miners being for the most part a rough lot;
but C&#230;sar, having faith in the youth and beauty
of his sister to appeal to the chivalry of the men,
and insure a warm reception and proper treatment,
was strongly in favor of their trying their
fortune, and so she assented.</p>

<p>Had they been compelled to rely upon their own
accomplishments they would have fared badly in
regard to an audience, for the rough miners saw
nothing to attract them in the performance of a
quartet of children.</p>

<p>The elephant, however, was quite another matter.
He was well worth examining at close
quarters, and, moreover, it could not fail to be
amusing to see so huge and apparently clumsy a
creature doing tricks. Accordingly a large number
of them gathered, and noisily shouldered and
chaffed each other as they crowded close upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
space before the van in which the performance
was given.</p>

<p>Nadine was undeniably nervous. The big
coarse men frightened her, and she regretted
that she had yielded to C&#230;sar's persuasion. But
having once begun they must perforce go through
to the end, so she put on a brave face, and went
ahead.</p>

<p>The miners were pleased to be in a critical
mood. They jeered at C&#230;sar's jugglery, ridiculed
his playing, and sent poor little Abel off the stage
in tears. Of Nalla, however, they were good
enough to approve. He evidently realized their
expectations and put them in such good humor
that when, following him, Nadine appeared to
sing, they received her so warmly that for the
moment she forgot her nervousness, and bowed
and smiled back at them in a charming way that
evoked still more vigorous applause.</p>

<p>Accompanied by C&#230;sar on the mandolin she
sang a pretty little love song which took very
well, and was insistently encored. When she had
responded and C&#230;sar had announced that after
the collection was taken up the final act in which
all the animals appeared would be given, she
deemed it best not to send little Lydia among
those rough men, but to go herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, bowl in hand, she started on her
rounds, and at first although some of the men
tried to display their rude wit at her expense,
and were amused by the indignant flush which
crimsoned her countenance, she had no real
trouble until in going through one of the rear
rows a big black-bearded fellow attempted to
throw his arm about her and give her a kiss.</p>

<p>Nadine screamed, and by a quick movement
evaded the repulsive embrace, but the ruffian,
who had been drinking too much brandy, lurched
after her as she darted towards the van, calling
out:</p>

<p>"C&#230;sar! C&#230;sar! Help!"</p>

<p>C&#230;sar, who was at that moment behind the
curtain, dressing Vigilant for the next act,
dropped the dog, and rushed to the front, picking
up one of the foils on the way.</p>

<p>The black-bearded bully was close upon Nadine's
skirts, none of the other spectators having the
courage to interfere, and it seemed as if he might
reach her before C&#230;sar, when relief came from
an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>Old Nalla had stood beside the van solemnly
swaying his trunk, and to all appearance lost in
profound contemplation, until Nadine's scream
reached his ear. Then the great ragged flaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
were pricked up, and from in front of them the
bright, beady, little eyes peered forth keenly.
Without making a sound the huge creature
glided towards the audience, and was at the edge
of the crowd almost without being noticed.</p>

<p>At that moment Nadine flew past pursued by
the bully, whose outstretched hand sought to
grasp the long tresses of her beautiful hair. But
before it could close upon the silken braid a long
sinuous thing suddenly shot forth and enfolded
the ruffian. To his paralyzing horror he was
lifted from his feet, and swung into the air amid
the panic-stricken outcries of the spectators. No
one thought any more of Nadine. Their eyes
were fixed upon the bully struggling vainly in
the irresistible grasp of Nalla's trunk, and shouting
frantically for help.</p>

<p>The elephant held him thus on high for one
thrilling moment and then flung him to one side,
as though he had been a bundle of straw instead
of being a hulking big fellow weighing full two
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>He fell upon the hard pavement with a terrible
thud, and lay there so still that the appalled
spectators thought he must be dead.</p>

<p>Nadine was the first to be at his side. The instant
Nalla intervened she divined what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
happen. More than once she had seen him pick
up fierce dogs with that marvelous weapon of
his, and throw them so far that they never
returned to the attack.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope he isn't dead!" she panted. "It
would be dreadful if Nalla killed him."</p>

<p>The big gross body showed no sign of life, and
the people crowded around it making all sorts of
futile suggestions, but doing nothing, when a
couple of gendarmes appeared, and ordered them
to stand aside.</p>

<p>One of them then examined the man carefully,
and, to Nadine's inexpressible relief, announced
that he was not dead, only insensible, and he
bade his comrade go for a surgeon.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the latter returned with a
spectacled person who looked very wise and dignified,
and proceeded to make a thorough examination
of the insensible man.</p>

<p>"There is probably some concussion of the
brain," he announced, "but not of a serious character.
How was he injured?"</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen began to speak at once in response,
but the next moment gave way to Nadine, who
described what had happened in a clear correct
manner.</p>

<p>"Hum! hum!" murmured the surgeon. "A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
very odd accident indeed in this quarter of the
globe, and the rascal richly deserved what befell
him. Where is this highly intelligent elephant?
I should like to make his acquaintance."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar had hustled Nalla off behind the scenes,
but on Nadine calling out:</p>

<p>"C&#230;sar! C&#230;sar! Bring Nalla out!" he forthwith
led him out again.</p>

<p>The surgeon bowed gravely to the great beast,
who returned the salute with a gracious wave of
his trunk, for Nalla never erred in discriminating
between friends and foes.</p>

<p>"I am very pleased to meet you, Sir Elephant,"
said the surgeon. "You have just given a proof
of your sagacity that I regret I was not present
to witness. May I express the wish that you
will always be as ready to champion the fair and
defend the weak!"</p>

<p>As he said the last words he bowed low to
Nadine, who smiled and blushed in return, and
then he withdrew to give further directions concerning
his patient.</p>

<p>Both Nadine and C&#230;sar were much concerned
lest, when the bully recovered his senses, he would
endeavor to get revenge upon Nalla, and so give
them a great deal of trouble. But their fears
were groundless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until late in the following day that
he recovered from the effects of his downfall, and
then he had the good sense to think only of
returning to his work with as little delay as
possible, so that no more was heard about the
matter.</p>

<p>The Tambys were glad to leave Malaventure
at an early hour the following morning. Owing
to the interruption right in the middle of taking
up the collection their receipts amounted to only
a few francs, and the fright which Nadine got
told upon her nerves so that it was several days
before she entirely regained her normal serenity.</p>

<p>Pushing on steadily in the direction of Beaulieu
they came to an ideal spot for a few days' rest.
It was a snug little dell beside a clear running
stream, and sheltered by a semicircle of thick-set
trees.</p>

<p>"C&#230;sar," said Nadine, wrinkling her white
forehead with a profound air of thought, "we
have been working very hard this summer, and
I think that before we get to Beaulieu, where we
shall have to give two performances every day
while the fair lasts, we ought to take a holiday&mdash;don't
you think so, my brother?"</p>

<p>"Right you are, my dear!" cried C&#230;sar, delighted
at the suggestion. "I'm just dead tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of keeping on day after day like this. Let us
stay here as long as we can, eh?"</p>

<p>Of course Abel and Lydia gleefully concurred,
and when Nalla and Steady were consulted, they
clearly signified their approval, while Vigilant,
divining that there was something to be joyful
over, barked his best, and frisked about merrily.
So the matter was settled, and permission having
been obtained from the authorities of the village
to which the chosen spot belonged, they prepared
to spend several days in well-earned idleness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">NALLA PLAYS PRANKS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The weather was glorious. By day the sun
poured down his golden warmth from an almost
unclouded sky, and by night the harvest moon at
her full rode high in the heavens. The four
children forgot all their sorrows and cares for
the time. Thanks to their success at Morainville,
and the good hopes they cherished of profitable
patronage at Beaulieu, they felt no concern
about finances. It was a case with them of eat&mdash;drink&mdash;sleep,
sufficient for the day are the blessings
thereof; to-morrow can take care of itself.</p>

<p>Nadine was the only one who pretended to do
any work, excepting of course that C&#230;sar looked
after the feeding of Nalla, old Steady being able
to look after himself as the grass was abundant
in their vicinity.</p>

<p>Nadine, being the little housewife, in addition
to having the daily meals upon her mind, found
much necessary sewing to keep her clever fingers
busy, and it was only when C&#230;sar would snatch
the garment away from her, crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, let that alone for a while, sister. You
work quite too hard. You must play with us a
little," would she laughingly obey orders, and go
off with the others for a romp or a ramble.</p>

<p>Of course their presence aroused the curiosity
of the people in the neighborhood, and they had
many visitors, who for the most part behaved
very well, some indeed bringing them welcome
presents of fruit and milk and butter, which
were keenly appreciated.</p>

<p>As might be expected, they begged for a performance,
and in view of their kind treatment,
Nadine thought they could not very well refuse;
so she promised that they would give one on the
evening before their departure.</p>

<p>The happy restful days slipped by all too
quickly, and the end of their short holiday was
at hand.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" sighed C&#230;sar. "This is our last
day. We must be on the road again to-morrow
if we would reach Beaulieu in time to get a good
position. I do wish we could stay another week."</p>

<p>"So do I," chirped little Abel. "Why can't
we? It's so nice here, and we needn't be in such
a hurry, surely."</p>

<p>"But we do need," responded Nadine, patting
the little fellow affectionately on the head. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
is important that we should get to the fair before
the best places are taken, for we must make all
the money there that we possibly can. The
winter will soon be coming on, when we can't
earn anything, you know."</p>

<p>Abel made a rueful grimace, but did not continue
the argument. Nadine was right of course.
She always was. Nobody could be wiser than
Nadine. Yet there were times when it went
against the grain to do everything just as she
wished.</p>

<p>However, there was still a whole day left, so
let them make the most of it. In the evening
they would give their performance and the next
morning they would resume their journey.</p>

<p>In the course of his roaming about the country,
C&#230;sar had found a large deep pool not far
down the stream from their camping-place, in
which he had enjoyed sundry refreshing baths.
It now occurred to him that it was just the
place for another purpose.</p>

<p>"Look here, Nadine," said he, "old Nalla hasn't
had a good bath for a long time, and I'm sure it
would do him good. Suppose we take him down
to the pool I've been bathing in, and let him
have a dip in it. I'm sure he'd enjoy it immensely,
and it would be good for him, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you're right, C&#230;sar," replied Nadine.
"We will take him down there after
dinner, and then he'll be in fine trim for the
performance this evening."</p>

<p>Accordingly, right after dinner the whole family,
accompanied by Vigilant, left Steady to his
browsing, and went off down stream escorting
Nalla, who trumpeted cheerfully in evident expectation
of some sort of a treat.</p>

<p>When they reached the pool C&#230;sar, pointing to
it, said:</p>

<p>"There, Nalla, is a splendid place for you to
have a bath, such as you haven't had for a long
time. In you go, old fellow, and enjoy yourself."</p>

<p>The elephant needed no urging. The day was
hot, the flies troublesome, the water cool and inviting.
With a blast of delight through his
trunk, and a flapping of his great ears, he strode
into the pool, and did not stop until the water
had almost reached the top of his back. Then he
gave himself up to the enjoyment of his bath
with the most amusing abandon. He wallowed
in the cool clear water without heed to the stirring
up of the mud. He sank down in it, leaving
only the tip of his trunk above the surface. He
filled his trunk with the water, and blew it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
again, sending the muddy spray to a considerable
distance&mdash;in fact, no schoolboy in a "swimming-hole"
on a broiling midsummer day could have
enjoyed himself more thoroughly.</p>

<p>The Tambys, seated in the shade on the bank,
watched his antics with lively appreciation.
Nothing was too good for Nalla in their opinion.
They had no better friend than the faithful,
docile elephant, and they loved him as deeply as
an animal could be loved.</p>

<p>The time slipped by, and Nalla showed no signs
of growing weary of his fun. He would come
out into the shallower part of the pool at intervals
and squirt the muddy water over his back
and sides, and then he would plunge in again,
going almost out of sight.</p>

<p>Presently C&#230;sar considered that he had enough
of it, and that he ought to come out in order to
be made ready for the parade through the village
street, which would precede the performance.
So he went to the edge of the pool, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Nalla, you've had a grand time, and
you'd better come out and get dried off, so come
along, old fellow."</p>

<p>Nalla looked at him with his absurdly small
eyes, in which there surely lurked a mischievous
twinkle, but made no move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry up, you lazy chap!" called C&#230;sar
laughingly. "Don't be so slow. We have to
prepare for the parade."</p>

<p>Nalla manifestly understood what was wanted
of him, but, instead of obeying, retreated further
into the pool.</p>

<p>This angered C&#230;sar, whose temper was of the
quickest, anyway, and he stamped his foot as he
shouted:</p>

<p>"Here, now, no nonsense! You must come
out, and that right away. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Nalla, with admirably simulated reluctance,
moved slowly shoreward, until he was within a
few yards of C&#230;sar, and then, pointing his trunk
at him, he squirted from it a quantity of muddy
water that drenched and dirtied the boy from
head to foot, and nearly knocked him over.</p>

<p>Almost blinded, and wholly enraged, C&#230;sar
picked up a stick and threw it at the elephant
with all his might. But he might as well have
thrown it at the side of a house for all the
effect it had on Nalla's massive head. The cute
little eyes only twinkled the more merrily, and
their owner backed away again, as if he had
changed his mind about coming ashore.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar was in a towering passion. The elephant
had certainly added injury to insult, and had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
been in the boy's power to punish him severely,
he would have delighted in doing it.</p>

<p>Nadine now felt it time to intervene.</p>

<p>"Let me try what I can do with Nalla," she
said gently to C&#230;sar. "While you go back to
the van and change your clothes. I am sure I
can manage him."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar was very loath to confess himself beaten,
and Nadine had to do some coaxing before she
could get him to follow her suggestions. But at
last, after another effort to make Nalla stir by
abusing him vigorously, he gave up in despair,
and went off to the van to put on dry clothes.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone Nadine tried her hand.
She went to the water's edge, for she felt sure
Nalla would not treat her as he had done C&#230;sar,
and stretching out her hand which contained a
slice of bread left over from their lunch, said in
her most winning tone:</p>

<p>"Come here, Nalla. I have a bit of bread for
you, and I want you to leave the water. You've
been in it quite long enough."</p>

<p>Nalla gave her a look that said plainly:</p>

<p>"I understand you perfectly, and of course
you're right, so I suppose, now that I have had
my fun, I may as well do what you wish."</p>

<p>So, slowly moving his vast bulk, he came towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
her, picked up the bread with his trunk,
passed it into his cavernous mouth, and continued
his way out of the water, until he stood on the
grass, a very muddy, but very contented creature.</p>

<p>"You dear old thing!" cried Nadine, patting
the end of his trunk affectionately. "I knew
you'd obey me. You just love me, don't you?
and I love you."</p>

<p>Nalla returned the caress after his own fashion,
and then, without another word, proceeded back
to the van, his whole gait and manner expressing
the utmost good-humor. He had had his fun,
and he was now ready to return to duty.</p>

<p>By the time they had all returned to the camping-place,
C&#230;sar had quite recovered his equanimity,
and joined heartily in the laughter at
Nalla's impertinence.</p>

<p>"He got the best of me that time, and no mistake,"
he said; "but I'll be even with him yet,
see if I'm not!"</p>

<p>They made haste to deck themselves out for the
parade, and spent an hour marching up and down
the village street, while C&#230;sar from the howdah
on Nalla's back, called out the place and time of
the performance.</p>

<p>Then back to the van for supper, and after supper
a general move into the village where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
found a capital location, in a small square beside
the town-hall.</p>

<p>"We shall no doubt have a good crowd," Nadine
remarked thoughtfully, when the simple
preparations had been completed, "for the people
have certainly taken a lot of interest in us, and
have been very kind too, but perhaps they may
not have much money to spare. They don't seem
to be rich around here."</p>

<p>"It won't be another Morainville, that's certain,"
said C&#230;sar, shaking his head dolefully.
"Such luck as we had there doesn't come often.
But," he added, straightening himself up, and
looking more cheerful, "we'll give them the best
performance we can, and hope that they will give
us all the money they can, eh?"</p>

<p>The villagers began to gather early, and by the
time the performance opened every seat was
filled with women and girls, while a crowd of
men and boys stood up behind, or squatted upon
the ground wherever a clear view of the stage
could be obtained.</p>

<p>One after another the different acts were given,
and warmly received. A more appreciative gathering
could hardly have been desired. C&#230;sar's
juggling, Nadine's singing, the animals' acting,
and Lydia's dancing were all enthusiastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
encored. But when the little bowl appeared a
marked change came over the spirit of the spectators.
They not only grew indifferent very suddenly,
but actually seemed anxious to slip away.</p>

<p>This was not a new experience for the Tambys,
and hitherto they had been content to take it
silently, but this time C&#230;sar's blood was stirred.
He had not counted upon any such meanness, and
the indignation it aroused gave him courage to
do what he had never done before.</p>

<p>Springing upon the stage he called for attention
with an emphatic gesture, and, when all eyes were
turned upon him, he began an address to the
assemblage.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "you have done us the
honor to attend our simple performance, and you
have shown by your applause that it has pleased
you. Now you must know that we do not give
these performances for our own amusement, but
to gain our daily bread. We are by no means
well-off even if we do possess an elephant and a
horse. We need every sou that we can earn to
pay for the food of our animals and ourselves,
and to meet our other needs. If you have enjoyed
our performance so much we would like you to
show it not only by applauding, but by putting
into the bowl which my little sister is about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
pass around, what you can spare us. We do not
expect silver from everybody, you know," he
added with a humorous twinkle of his eyes.
"We are glad to get copper&mdash;if there is only
enough of it."</p>

<p>This clever little speech, delivered in a clear
voice, and without the slightest suggestion of
presumption, touched the listeners in the right
way. It opened both their hearts and their
pockets, and when Lydia went her rounds
amongst them they responded in a most creditable
manner, so that the receipts were enough to
cover a whole week's expenses.</p>

<p>Nadine was particularly pleased at this, because
it enabled them to push right on to Beaulieu without
halting to give performances <i>en route</i>. Their
holiday therefore was an unalloyed success, and,
thoroughly refreshed by it, they kept on day
after day until at last they reached Beaulieu,
a whole day before the opening of the fair, and
in ample time to secure an excellent position
for their van, where it could not fail to attract
attention, and so insure no lack of spectators
when they gave their performances.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">AT THE BEAULIEU FAIR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A country fair was no novelty to the Tambys.
They had attended too many of them already in
their young lives to get excited over the inevitable
bustle and confusion. Their chief concern
was not to see everybody and everything, but to
attract as large gatherings as possible to their
performances, and induce them to give liberally
when the little bowl was passed around.</p>

<p>This time they felt full of hope. They were
greatly benefited by the brief holiday, and they
were thoroughly satisfied with the location they
had secured, and so on the opening day of the
fair, after having carefully locked up the van,
and seen to it that Nalla and Steady were
securely tethered, they left Vigilant in charge
of their property while all four of them made
a tour of the streets which were given up to the
fair.</p>

<p>In this they had a double purpose. They would
"see the sights," and they would also get a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
idea of what were the rival attractions with
which they must needs contend for the patronage
of the people.</p>

<p>They found the streets thick-set with booths
displaying all sorts of small-wares, and thronged
with light-hearted folk, who, if they had not
much money to spend, would at all events get the
full value of every sou with which they parted.
It was neither a brilliant nor a costly display, but
it was quite attractive notwithstanding, and the
two younger Tambys saw many things that they
very much wanted to purchase.</p>

<p>Now it would be Abel, and then again Lydia,
dragging Nadine or C&#230;sar up to some booth,
and eagerly indicating the object that caught
their fancy.</p>

<p>But their cutest coaxings were for the most
part in vain. It was to earn money, and not to
spend it, that they had come to the fair, and
beyond the purchase of a few inexpensive trifles
Nadine would not be persuaded.</p>

<p>"No, no, my dears," was her firm though gentle
reply. "All our money must go for necessaries.
We have none to spend upon things we don't
really need. I wish very much we could afford
to spend twenty francs or even more on the
pretty things we see in the booths, but if we did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
we might have to go hungry, and we wouldn't
like that, would we, little ones?"</p>

<p>Of course they had to submit as cheerfully as
they could manage. It was no use pouting or
sulking, and indeed they yielded to their elder
sister's rule with uniformly good grace.</p>

<p>Having completed their tour of inspection, and
satisfied themselves that, although there would
be no lack of competition for popular favor, they
stood a good chance of reaping a fair share of
the harvest of coin to be distributed by the pleasure-seekers,
they returned to where they had left
their van.</p>

<p>To their acute amazement and consternation
the familiar weather-worn house on wheels, which
contained all their possessions, save the three
animals, had disappeared, and in its place was
another, larger, and newer, painted in glaring
gaudy colors, and having a general air of vulgar
audacity.</p>

<p>"Why, C&#230;sar!" cried Nadine, her fine eyes
wide with alarm, and her heart beating fast.
"What can this mean? Who has taken away
our van, and put another in its place?"</p>

<p>C&#230;sar understood the situation at a glance.
The owners of the other van, finding the
location which they had in view already taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and learning that it was only four children who
owned the shabby old affair that stood there, had
had the audacity to put Steady into the shafts,
and remove the van out of their way while they
put their own in its place.</p>

<p>Burning with indignation he went up to the
van, and knocked at the closed door. After some
delay it was opened by a large black-bearded
rough-looking man, who demanded with an oath
what the boy wanted.</p>

<p>Undismayed by the ruffianly appearance of the
fellow, C&#230;sar spoke up stoutly:</p>

<p>"What have you done with our van, and what
right had you to take it away, and put yours in
its place?"</p>

<p>Removing a cigarette from his lips the man sent
a puff of smoke right into C&#230;sar's face, and then,
with an insolent chuckle, said:</p>

<p>"Well, my young cock, and what are you
going to do about it?"</p>

<p>Half-blinded and choked by the foul reek of
the coarse tobacco, and roused to fury by the ruffian's
insolence, C&#230;sar for a moment could not
speak. When he did find words it was to pour
out his wrath in language so biting that the man
was angered in his turn, and he made as though
he would strike the boy, but checked himself when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Nadine screamed, and darted in between them,
crying:</p>

<p>"Come away, C&#230;sar. It's no use quarreling
with that fellow. We must find the gendarme.
He will get us our place back again."</p>

<p>The man grunted scornfully. What cared he
for their threat? He had the place now, and they
would find it no easy matter to dislodge him.</p>

<p>The first thing, of course, was to find their van
and animals. These were presently discovered in
an obscure lane not far away, none the worse
for their being moved. While assuring himself
that everything was intact a daring idea flashed
into C&#230;sar's brain. To appeal to the authorities
would mean delay, and perhaps disappointment
in the end, as they might have difficulty in establishing
their prior right to the location. But
there was another way of regaining their rights.
The intruders had taken the law into their
own hands, why should not the Tambys do likewise?</p>

<p>He at once unfolded his scheme to Nadine.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, C&#230;sar!" she exclaimed. "Don't try
that. You'd certainly get into a big row. He is
such a bad looking fellow."</p>

<p>But C&#230;sar was determined. They had the
right on their side, and he felt confident that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
there was a row, and a crowd gathered, that the
sympathy would be with them, not with the
ruffian, and they would regain their place.</p>

<p>So, with many misgivings, Nadine consented,
and they set to work at once. Steady was put
into the shafts, and the van, followed by Nalla,
drawn back into the square.</p>

<p>Then C&#230;sar mounted the elephant. The man
had gone back into his van, and closed the door.
Obeying his young master's orders as accurately
as if he had possessed human intelligence, Nalla
seized the shaft of the intruding van, and began
to pull it out into the center of the square.</p>

<p>At the first movement the man flung open the
door, swearing furiously, and shouting out:</p>

<p>"What are you doing? Leave my van alone!
How dare you interfere with it?"</p>

<p>When he saw how it was being moved, however,
he made no demonstrations against the
elephant. He was altogether too big an antagonist.
It was a case where discretion was
decidedly the better part of valor.</p>

<p>But he abused C&#230;sar in the vilest language,
striving to terrify him by the sheer violence of
his threats.</p>

<div class="figcenter newpage">
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="504" height="800" alt="Nalla" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap">Nalla seized the Shaft of the intruding Van.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>C&#230;sar, securely seated upon Nalla's neck, only
laughed at him, while, without pausing, the elephant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
tugged away at the van until it was drawn
well out into the middle of the square.</p>

<p>By this time quite a crowd of spectators had
gathered, and, Nadine having in her own vivacious
way explained what it all meant, they unanimously
took her side. If the infuriated owner
of the van had attempted to resort to violent
measures he would assuredly have found himself
mobbed in short order.</p>

<p>The space being now clear, C&#230;sar slipped down
from Nalla's neck, and bidding the sagacious
monster stand in front of the strange van in
readiness to check any action on the part of its
proprietor, he took hold of Steady's bridle, and
proceeded to put his van into its former position
amidst the approving laughter of the crowd.</p>

<p>Almost beside himself with rage the owner of
the other van rushed at C&#230;sar with fists clenched
intending to pummel him. But before he could
reach him Nalla's long supple trunk swept his
legs from under him, and sent him headlong,
whilst the spectators roared with delight at his
ignominious downfall.</p>

<p>Like all bullies he was in reality a coward, and,
it being very plain that everything was against
him, he submitted to defeat with a very bad grace
to be sure, but without any further attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
reprisals. Procuring his own horses he hitched
them to the van, and drew it away to another
part of the town, vowing vengeance against the
youngsters who had thus dared to expose and
discomfit him.</p>

<p>Nadine felt worried over the affair, but C&#230;sar
made light of it.</p>

<p>"We'll see no more of that rascal," he said,
confidently. "He knows he's killed himself in
this place by his mean trick, and instead of
doing us harm he has really done us good, for
he has got the people interested in us, and they
will be all the more likely to come to the performance."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar was right enough in this. As was the
case when the mischievous students stampeded
Nalla, an apparent misfortune turned out a benefit.
The episode with the man of the black beard,
and the brave way in which the young people had
borne themselves, as also the wonderful intelligence
shown by Nalla, proved an admirable advertisement,
and their first performance was
anticipated with much interest.</p>

<p>Relying upon a larger patronage than they
were wont to have at their ordinary stopping-places,
they thought it wise to hire half a hundred
chairs, for which they would charge ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
sous each, five sous being asked for a seat upon
the planks, and standing room being free.</p>

<p>Before the hour announced for opening the
people had already begun to gather, and by seven
o'clock every seat was occupied, and a goodly
number were standing behind them. They were
all in the best of humor, and prepared to enjoy
themselves by heartily appreciating what the
Tamby family had provided for them.</p>

<p>This good fortune attended them throughout
the whole week of the fair. Nadine's sweet singing,
C&#230;sar's clever juggling, the amusing antics
of Vigilant, and the remarkable intelligence
displayed by Nalla and Steady maintained their
interest for the populace to the end, and when
on Saturday night, tired out but happy, they
counted up their profits after the payment of all
expenses, they found that they had no less than
five hundred francs to the good.</p>

<p>"Why, that is a small fortune, isn't it, Nadine?"
exclaimed C&#230;sar joyously. "That will
help us over the winter finely, and we will doubtless
make more before the season ends, eh?"</p>

<p>"I hope we will," responded Nadine, her
charming face radiant at the handsome result of
their week's work. "We'll need it all before
spring, and we must be very careful how we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
spend what we have. It won't do to be extravagant
because it seems such a big sum of money
to have at once. But what was that?" she cried,
her face suddenly growing grave. "Did you
see anything, C&#230;sar?"</p>

<p>"No," replied C&#230;sar, looking all about him.
"I saw nothing&mdash;what was it startled you?"</p>

<p>"I may be mistaken," answered Nadine, speaking
in a steadier tone, "but I thought I saw a
face peering in at the window just as I was putting
the money away, and it frightened me a
little. It would be dreadful if any one tried to
rob us of our money, wouldn't it?"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">THE RASCAL'S REVENGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>C&#230;sar's laughing face grew serious at what
Nadine said.</p>

<p>"That is so, Nadine," he responded. "I hadn't
thought of it before. Doubtless it is well known
that our performances have been very successful,
and that we have taken in a good deal of money,
and it may be that some of the other mountebanks
who have been less fortunate would like
very well to rob us of the results of our hard
work."</p>

<p>"Oh! C&#230;sar, you make me nervous!" cried
Nadine with a pretty shiver. "What can we do
to protect ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Tut! sister, I'm not in earnest," rejoined
C&#230;sar smilingly. "There's nothing to be afraid
of. There are only honest people round about us.
The next vans to ours are occupied by the performers
of the Sito circus, and none of them
would think of doing anything so mean. Nevertheless,
just to make your mind easy, I will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
guard to-night, and at the first sign of anything
suspicious I will give the alarm."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry that we've had to put Nalla
away off there with the circus animals," said
Nadine in a tone of regret. "If he were only
right beside our van we needn't worry at all, for
he'd take care that no bad character got too
near us."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied C&#230;sar. "With Nalla
on guard we could sleep as soundly as we pleased."</p>

<p>"Look here, C&#230;sar," exclaimed Nadine, her
face brightened by a happy thought which had
just come to her. "I know what we can do. As
soon as we have had our supper the whole four
of us can go down where Nalla is, and sleep there
under his protection. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"A capital idea, sister," answered C&#230;sar. "If
we were quite sure that there is any real danger.
But you see we are not, and if we leave our van
and go down to the stables for the night the
people might suspect us of some evil intentions.
No&mdash;no&mdash;we will all stay here, and I will be
sentinel while the rest of you sleep comfortably."</p>

<p>Considering all the hard work and the excitement
that C&#230;sar had been having it was certainly
very unselfish on his part&mdash;especially as he really
felt no anxiety&mdash;to undertake to keep awake all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
night, and Nadine, striving to throw off the depressing
nervousness which had come upon her,
declared that it really was not necessary, that she
would put the bag of money under her pillow,
where it could not be touched without awaking
her, and that C&#230;sar must go to bed like the rest,
or she would sit up to keep him company.</p>

<p>The result of it was that they succeeded in reassuring
one another so completely as to decide
that no one should remain on guard, and in
excellent spirits they sat down to their supper, for
which they had all the best of appetites.</p>

<p>It was a capital supper, too, as Nadine, the
careful little housewife, felt justified by their
extra earnings during the week in providing
something better than their ordinary fare. So
the table showed a plump roast chicken, a succulent
salad, a large loaf of white bread with a
fine brown crust, a generous pat of golden butter,
and a steaming pot of fragrant coffee.</p>

<p>The four young people ate and drank and
talked with all their might. Everything was delicious
except the coffee, that had a strange taste
to which C&#230;sar was the first to call attention.</p>

<p>"Why, Nadine!" he exclaimed after swallowing
half-a-cupful at one draught. "What's the
matter with the coffee? It tastes so queer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>Nadine had noticed it herself, but, supposing it
was just some little mistake in the brewing, had
said nothing, and gone on drinking it, while Abel
and Lydia were too keen of appetite to be particular.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," replied Nadine, being
thus challenged, and feeling that her culinary
reputation was at stake. "I made it myself, and
I didn't notice anything different from other
times. Perhaps there is too much chicory in it."</p>

<p>"That may be it," returned C&#230;sar. "Anyway
I'm too thirsty to bother. I'll just finish off
my share."</p>

<p>No sooner was the meal finished than Lydia,
who seemed particularly tired, sat down on the
floor beside Nadine's chair, and letting her head
droop upon her little mother's knee, fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>"Poor little pet," murmured Nadine, fondling
the golden curls. "Just see, C&#230;sar, how tired
Lydia is! The sand-man has taken her by surprise.
Indeed my own head feels very heavy."</p>

<p>"That's because we've been working so hard,"
responded C&#230;sar. "We're just tired out, all of
us. Why, look at Abel&mdash;he's gone to sleep in his
chair, and I don't wonder at him, I feel completely
played out myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>"I must hurry and undress the little ones and
put them to bed," said Nadine, giving a great
yawn, and making an effort to open wide her
heavy-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear me! But how sleepy I feel. I can
scarcely hold my head up."</p>

<p>"No more can I," drawled C&#230;sar drowsily as
he dropped into a chair where a moment later he
was sound asleep, while Nadine, without accomplishing
what she had in mind, quickly followed
his example, so that long ere midnight the whole
four children were sunk in a profound slumber
that could hardly have been due merely to natural
fatigue.</p>

<p>It was a still dark night without a star showing
in the heavens, and the camp of the mountebanks
was as silent as a graveyard. Not a light shone
in any of the other vans. Tired out by their
week's work the occupants slept as sound as logs.</p>

<p>About one o'clock, two dark forms glided as
noiselessly as shadows towards the Tamby van,
and on getting close to it, halted to listen intently
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of your work, Fritsch?" whispered
one in a deep voice to the other.</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure, Wilhelm," was the cautiously
spoken reply. "I gave them a dose that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
keep them asleep until nine o'clock anyway, and
by that time I will have such a long start that
they will never overtake me."</p>

<p>It was, in fact, the man who had put his van
in the place the Tambys had first taken, and who,
on being compelled to get out again, had determined
to be revenged. Aided by his partner, he
was now about to carry out his nefarious design,
having succeeded in drugging the coffee they had
drunk at their supper, so that they were almost
insensible, and perfectly helpless.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Wilhelm, "let us go
ahead, and you understand that we will meet
you in the forest of Trefflieu three days hence."</p>

<p>Fritsch glanced anxiously about in every direction,
and bent his ear to listen for the slightest
sound.</p>

<p>"You hear nothing, eh?" he whispered to his
accomplice.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing. The coast is clear, hurry up!"
responded the other.</p>

<p>Moving stealthily Fritsch ascended the steps of
the van, and, finding the door unfastened, for
sleep had come upon the occupants too suddenly
for them to shut and bolt it as was their custom,
he slipped inside, making his way with utmost
caution. The lamp still burned dimly, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
its light he could find at once that for which he
had come. He was busy only for a moment, and
then he reappeared at the door bearing in his
arms a large bundle wrapped in a shawl.</p>

<p>"I have her all right," said he in a hoarse
whisper, his evil face lit up with a triumphant
smile.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" muttered the other, and the next
moment the two scoundrels disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<p>They went together as far as the gaudy van,
into which one of them entered, while the other,
carrying his burden, walked rapidly away out
into the country over the silent deserted roads.</p>

<p>The day dawned, and at an early hour the
occupants of the other vans began to bestir themselves.
The fair was over. There were no more
performances to be given. They were free to do
as they pleased. Each party had its own plans.
This one would hurry off to another place, and
continue the campaign. That one would take a
few days' rest in some quiet spot. One was going
north, and another south. But they were all
going somewhere. It was no use staying any
longer at Beaulieu, nor coming back there again
until next year.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this bustle, however, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
was no sign of life about the Tamby van. Although
it was after eight o'clock they still slept
on when they were wont to be up and about at
six.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nalla over at the stables was calling
for his young owners with persistent and ear-splitting
trumpetings. The sagacious creature
knew very well that this tardiness was something
altogether out of the usual, and he proclaimed
his anxiety to the world. He was saying as
plainly as he could:</p>

<p>"There must be something wrong. Won't
somebody find out what it is? I never knew
C&#230;sar and Abel to be so late giving me my breakfast."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what can be the matter with that big
brute?" the other mountebanks asked impatiently.
"He's making such a tremendous row!"
But none of them were wise enough to catch his
meaning, and institute inquiry.</p>

<p>Finally, about nine o'clock, C&#230;sar awoke, feeling
very stupid, and having a dull headache. He
rubbed his eyes, yawned widely, and looked about
him. There were Nadine and Abel, still sound
asleep beside the table with their heads pillowed
upon their arms. Evidently no one had gone to
bed. But where was Lydia?</p>




<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The absence of his sister did not at first alarm
C&#230;sar, because he took it for granted she had
awakened earlier than the rest, and had gone
outside to get the fresh air. So he rose from his
seat, stretched himself, yawned once more mightily,
and went out quietly, thinking that he would
look for Lydia before arousing Nadine.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found the square almost
deserted, and no sign of Lydia. This made him
uneasy, and, re-entering the van, he shook Nadine
gently, calling out:</p>

<p>"Nadine! Nadine! Wake up, it's after nine
o'clock!"</p>

<p>Nadine opened her eyes slowly and painfully.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock," she repeated after him in a
dreamy fashion.</p>

<p>"Yes, nine o'clock!" reiterated C&#230;sar, "and
how was it that none of us went to bed?"</p>

<p>At this Nadine sprang to her feet, thoroughly
awake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, neither we did! How extraordinary!
We were so tired out that we just fell asleep in
our chairs. You wake up Abel while I go and
see where Lydia is."</p>

<p>"Do you hear Nalla calling?" C&#230;sar asked.
"The poor fellow must think we're all dead.
We never left him so late without attention
before."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do hear him," responded Nadine,
a bewildered look on her face. "It is certainly
very strange. I cannot understand it at all."</p>

<p>She had been moving about while she was
speaking, putting things to rights with deft
feminine skill, when suddenly she stopped, the
color left her face, her eyes started from their
sockets, she staggered as though she would fall,
but steadied herself against the table as she
shrieked:</p>

<p>"C&#230;sar! C&#230;sar! We have been robbed!"</p>

<p>"Robbed!" C&#230;sar echoed, darting forward to
her side. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, our money, it is all gone!" wailed
Nadine. "You know I put it all back into the
bag after we had counted it, and was going to
hide it in my bed when Lydia fell asleep beside
me, and a few minutes after I went to sleep too.
I must have left it upon the table, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
wicked thief has crept in and stolen it. Oh dear!
oh dear! what shall we do? All our money
stolen!" and throwing herself down upon the
table she sobbed as though her heart would break.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar, although he was appalled himself at
this cruel misfortune, did his best to comfort her,
and he and Abel almost turned the interior of the
van upside down in a vain endeavor to find the
missing bag.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it has been stolen," he confessed
at last. "There's not a trace of it. Come,
Nadine, let us be brave. We may get it all back
again. Do you hunt up Lydia, while I go and
find one of the gendarmes and tell him what has
happened to us."</p>

<p>In the extremity of her grief at the loss of the
money, Nadine had for the time forgotten her
little sister, but the moment C&#230;sar reminded her
of Lydia she sprang to her feet, dashed away her
tears with her hands, and choking back her sobs,
ran out into the square, crying:</p>

<p>"Lydia! Lydia! where are you?"</p>

<p>But no response came in Lydia's sweet voice,
for at that moment the poor child was far away,
hidden in a thick wood, and watched over by a
wretch who threatened to kill her if she made the
least outcry, so that she dared not utter a sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
although there was no stopping the tears that
poured down her cheeks. The scoundrels had
stolen both the money and the child, the beauty
and grace of the latter being so marked that they
coveted her for their own business, knowing well
how strong an attraction she would be.</p>

<p>At this moment M. Sito, manager of the circus
with whose animals Nalla and Steady had been
stabled, happened along, and seeing that the
children were in some grievous trouble, kindly
inquired what was the matter, and if he could
be of any assistance.</p>

<p>When Nadine apprised him of Lydia's mysterious
disappearance he knitted his brows, and
thought deeply for a moment. He had noted
the pretty child, and had himself entertained the
thought that she might easily be trained to be a
great success in the circus, and knowing only too
well how many evil characters there had been in
the town during the fair, his quick intelligence
carried him to the right conclusion.</p>

<p>But he would not let his suspicions be known
to Nadine until they were confirmed. Adopting,
therefore, an air of cheerful confidence, he said,
patting Nadine encouragingly:</p>

<p>"Don't worry. Lydia is not far off. She has
perhaps gone for a stroll through the streets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
has lost her way. We will go and look for her,
eh?"</p>

<p>Just then C&#230;sar returned accompanied by two
gendarmes to whom Nadine at once addressed
herself, explaining her great trouble as best she
could in spite of the sobs that choked her
utterance.</p>

<p>The brigadier, a tall handsome man, who had
not, however, a good expression, twirled his
superb mustache with a grand air as he said in a
patronizing tone:</p>

<p>"Is it all true what you have been telling me?
I give you warning that we gendarmes are not to
be trifled with. It will go hard with you if you
are making a great deal out of nothing. You
assert that some one has taken away your little
sister, and robbed you of all your money?"</p>

<p>"It is unhappily only too true," responded
Nadine with a fresh burst of tears. "Won't you
help us recover them? Oh! It is dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Wait now, my girl," said the brigadier, looking
very important. "Don't be so impatient.
You must first answer me some questions. And,
mind you, answer them correctly. You need not
try to deceive the authorities."</p>

<p>Nadine dried her tears, checked her sobs, and
faced the man with a frank, fearless countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
There was no reason why she should conceal
anything. She was ready to answer any proper
question.</p>

<p>"First of all," began the brigadier. "Where
are your parents?"</p>

<p>"Alas! we are orphans," was the reply given
in a low tone.</p>

<p>"That is not what I asked you," retorted the
officer sharply. "Where are your parents?"</p>

<p>"We have no parents," responded Nadine, the
tears returning to her eyes. "We are orphans,
as I told you."</p>

<p>"Durien," said the brigadier to the other gendarme,
who had produced a note-book, "write
that down&mdash;orphans."</p>

<p>"It is put down, brigadier."</p>

<p>"And how do you support yourselves?" was
the next question.</p>

<p>"We are mountebanks," answered Nadine,
"and we give performances with the assistance
of our animals."</p>

<p>"With the assistance of your animals, you say!
Then you have animals also. What are they,
and where are they?"</p>

<p>Just then C&#230;sar came from the stables leading
Nalla and Steady, and followed by Vigilant, who
had as usual slept beside Nalla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"There they are," replied Nadine, pointing to
the approaching trio.</p>

<p>The brigadier regarded them with surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, that is a costly animal for orphans to
own!" he exclaimed. "How do you manage to
provide for his keep?"</p>

<p>"With what we earn, sir," answered Nadine.
"He is our best breadwinner too."</p>

<p>"Hum! hum! with what you earn," sneered
the brigadier, "and with what you steal also, of
course."</p>

<p>Nadine paled at the cruel words, and shrunk
back from the speaker as though he had struck
her. She was so hurt that she could not find
words in which to reply.</p>

<p>But C&#230;sar, thrilled with indignation at the
unmerited slur upon their character, spoke up
bravely:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gendarme," he said, "we are honest
folk, I would have you know, and you have no
right to insult us like that, and to add to my
sister's trouble when she has so much to bear
already."</p>

<p>The brigadier grew angry at once because a
mere boy had the audacity to speak so to one of
such importance as himself.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you brat!" he shouted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
"How dare you speak to me. You are showing
disrespect to the law."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gendarme," responded C&#230;sar in a submissive
tone, and bowing humbly before the
great man. "I beg your pardon. I had no
intention of being insolent, I assure you. I do
beg your pardon, sir."</p>

<p>The brigadier became more gracious. C&#230;sar's
politic apology appeased his wrath.</p>

<p>"'Tis well, youngster," he growled, as he gave
his big mustache a ferocious twist. "In view
of your age, and of the humble apology you
have made, I pardon you, but don't presume to
speak until you are asked. Now, Durien," he
called to the other gendarme, "we will make a
search of the vans there," pointing out those
belonging to the other mountebanks which still
remained.</p>

<p>But their search had no result, and the brigadier
then announced that Nadine, C&#230;sar, and Abel
must accompany him to the town-hall, where the
sous-pr&#233;fet would examine them before giving
orders for a more thorough search about the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>This announcement distressed Nadine greatly.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" she pleaded, "don't do that! Leave
us free to look for Lydia without losing another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
minute, or it will soon be too late. If she has
been carried off by evil men they are getting farther
away all the time, and we shan't be able to
overtake them. Oh, please let us alone, so that we
may do our best to find her!"</p>

<p>But the brigadier was obdurate. Having once
made known what in his great wisdom he thought
the proper course to pursue, he was not to be
turned aside from it by a mere chit of a girl.</p>

<p>So, drawing himself up to his full height, and
twirling his mustache in what he no doubt considered
a very stylish fashion, he said:</p>

<p>"I have no power to continue the search any
further at present. I must receive instructions
from the sous-pr&#233;fet, and before these can be
given it is necessary that you should make a
deposition."</p>

<p>Poor Nadine got bewildered. She was not
familiar with the words used by the gendarme,
and did not understand what that implied. If he
had said, "You must deposit some money," she
would have understood it at once, but "you must
make a deposition"&mdash;what could that be?</p>

<p>Just then she remembered the envelope that
kind Madame Prad&#232;re had given her with the
injunction that she was not to open it until some
time when she was in great difficulties. Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
that time had come. She could hardly be in a
more trying situation than she was with her
darling sister vanished, her money stolen, and this
heartless gendarme insisting that she must go
before the authorities, and make a deposition:</p>

<p>Slipping her hand into her bosom she drew out
the precious envelope. It had not been stolen
because she never parted with it.</p>

<p>"See, C&#230;sar," she said softly to her brother.
"This is what good Madame Prad&#232;re gave me
when I bade her 'Good-bye.' She said I wasn't to
open it until I was in great trouble. Hadn't I
better open it now?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded C&#230;sar. "This is indeed
the time. I wonder what it can contain?"</p>

<p>His curiosity was soon changed to amazement,
and then to joy, for when Nadine broke the seal,
and opened the envelope, there were two bank-notes
of a hundred francs each!</p>

<p>"Whew!" he exclaimed. "Isn't that fine?
Why, that's a lot of money. Nearly one-half of
what we have lost."</p>

<p>Nadine's sad face brightened at the sight of the
bank-notes. They might get them out of all their
difficulties, and help them to find Lydia. Holding
them in her hands she said to the gendarme:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, what will there be to pay?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>But the rude fellow gave a significant wink at
his companion as he said:</p>

<p>"Ah! ha! young lady, a moment ago you
were pretending that you had been robbed of all
your money, and now you bring out bank-notes
for a large amount with which to try and bribe
the gendarmes! You have been trying to deceive
us. Very well&mdash;we shall see. You must at
once tell us where you got that money."</p>

<p>"This money," faltered Nadine, not yet recovered
from her surprise and joy at its discovery,
"was given me by a very kind-hearted lady who
told me I was not to use it until I was in great
trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, of course," sneered the insolent
creature. "We know lots of kind-hearted ladies
who are in the way of giving one hundred franc
notes to strolling performers, don't we? We
shall have to clear all this up. I shall take charge
of that money in order to restore it to the proper
owner. And now, without wasting any more
words, do you put your things in order right
away, and come with me to the sous-pr&#233;fet right
away, where, without being impertinent, you
shall explain to the authorities the meaning of all
this. Get to work now. No more excuses. I
have taken too much time with you already."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Neither tears nor entreaties had any effect
upon the brigadier, and a little later the van of
the Tamby family, with a gendarme at either
side, was on its way to the court-house.</p>

<p>Nalla, his trunk hanging down despondently,
and giving vent to groanings that strongly resembled
sobs, followed in the rear, apparently
understanding and sharing in the overwhelming
trouble of his young owners.</p>

<p>The sous-pr&#233;fet was a stern old man, having
a high sense of his own importance, and of the
dignity of the law which he represented.</p>

<p>He listened gravely to the report of the
brigadier, who added many embellishments to
the actual facts in making it, and, deciding that
the case was one which would require careful
investigation, directed that the children should
be kept in confinement until he was at leisure
to give their matter due attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>And so behold the three of them without having
done the slightest harm, but on the contrary
been the victims of the cruelest wrong, put in
prison just as if they were malefactors!</p>

<p>Poor old Nalla, sorely perplexed at the whole
proceeding, followed them to the prison, and
would have liked to enter with them. But as
that, of course, was not possible, he took up his
station beside the door, swaying his trunk and
groaning in a piteous fashion.</p>

<p>Thus it came about, through the irony of fate,
that the money which the well-meaning Madame
Prad&#232;re had, in the goodness of her heart, given
the Tamby children to be a help to them at some
critical time, had only served to add to their
trouble. Because of its possession they were imprisoned
as thieves.</p>

<p>The brigadier, on finding such an amount as
two hundred francs in the hands of Nadine after
the girl had complained to him of having been
robbed of all her money, suspected that there
was something wrong. Her explanation that it
was a gift from a charitable lady seemed to him
very fishy, to say the least.</p>

<p>"These young vagabonds," he reasoned, "have
stolen that money, and we shall presently find
out the truth about it. When the sous-pr&#233;fet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
examines them they will be made to tell everything."</p>

<p>It is needless to say that that was a dreadful
night for the poor young Tambys. They spent
it in weeping and lamenting their cruel fate,
which they could not understand that they had
in any way deserved, although Nadine, the dear
innocent, seemed to think that she was in some
way to blame.</p>

<p>"Didn't I promise," she wailed, "when our
father died, that, being the eldest, I would take
such care of you, and yet I have allowed Lydia,
our little one, who has so much need of a mother,
to be carried off, the good God only knows
where!"</p>

<p>"Don't blame yourself, Nadine," said C&#230;sar
soothingly, putting his arm affectionately around
her. "We shall find her again, never fear. If
it costs my life I shall get her back again."</p>

<p>He was a sturdy high-spirited chap, C&#230;sar,
and although younger than Nadine, now that
she was so overcome with grief, he took upon
himself the part of comforter and champion.</p>

<p>But poor little Abel buried his head in her lap,
sobbing piteously, and murmuring "Lydia&mdash;Lydia&mdash;where
is my sister, Lydia?"</p>

<p>It was not until ten o'clock in the morning that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the key grated in the lock of the massive door,
which on opening disclosed the portly figure of
the brigadier.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said in his deep rough voice,
"come along with me. The sous-pr&#233;fet has
arrived, and is awaiting you, and he will attend
to your affair. I give you warning beforehand
that it will be useless for you to attempt to
deceive him. The sous-pr&#233;fet is a very clever
man, and has no pity for tramps who boldly tell
lies."</p>

<p>These cruel words stung Nadine and C&#230;sar so
that they found it hard to keep back a retort,
but they looked at each other in a significant
way, and in silence followed the bullying brigadier.</p>

<p>Patiently awaiting them at the door of the
prison were Vigilant and Nalla. The former, as
soon as he perceived his young owners, set up
a joyous barking and gamboling about them,
showing his affection and delight. Nalla, on his
part, waved his trunk up and down, and indulged
in funny rumblings which were expressive
of his gladness at seeing them again.</p>

<p>"Stay there!" commanded the brigadier
sternly, but the elephant took no notice of him,
and ambled along behind the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, and the streets of the
town of Beaulieu were full of people, many of
them being farming folk from the neighborhood,
who had come in to attend church, and through
the midst of this curious crowd the unfortunate
Tamby children, their faces crimsoned with
shame, were compelled to pass in charge of two
gendarmes, just as if they were criminals.</p>

<p>When they reached the entrance of the court-house,
Nadine turned to Nalla, and, patting his
trunk tenderly, said:</p>

<p>"Dear old friend, you must be very wise now,
very wise indeed, lest some fresh trouble come
upon us."</p>

<p>And while Nalla responded with his queer
grunting, Nadine saw that he too had his anxieties.
He turned his huge head from right to
left, looking at the children with his bright little
eyes in an inquiring way. The fact of the matter
was that the old fellow was seeking for his little
pet, Lydia. He could not understand her absence
from the group, and he wanted the others to explain
it to him. But that was just what they
could not do.</p>

<p>The sous-pr&#233;fet at Beaulieu was a retired army
officer, who had brought with him from the
service a very stern and imperious manner. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
had a white mustache and beard, and bushy
white eyebrows, which gave him such a cross
look, one could not expect to receive much
courtesy or consideration at his hands.</p>

<p>He was busy at a desk littered with papers
when the brigadier brought the Tambys before
him. At first sight of him the children were
filled with fear, his whole appearance was so
severe.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," said the brigadier, "I bring
the prisoners before you."</p>

<p>"Very well, wait there!" was the sharp reply,
given without looking up from the paper, at
which he continued to write.</p>

<p>"Wait here!" the brigadier repeated to the
children, who certainly had no thought of stirring,
however glad they would have been to do so.</p>

<p>For several minutes there was no sound save
the scratching of the magistrate's pen as he wrote
busily without taking any notice whatever of the
Tambys.</p>

<p>After a little he began to question the brigadier,
and to put down his answers in writing.
The brigadier told his story at length, and with
many big words, being evidently anxious to make
as much of it as possible.</p>

<p>When he had at last finished, the magistrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
turned his fierce eyes upon the children, and
scrutinized them sharply:</p>

<p>"But where are their parents?" he demanded
sternly.</p>

<p>"The little vagabonds insist upon it that they
have none," replied the gendarme.</p>

<p>"That they have none!" exclaimed the magistrate.
"Are they traveling about alone?"</p>

<p>"The young rascals pretend that they have lost
their father and mother," continued the brigadier.</p>

<p>The magistrate gave the children a piercing
glance. He evidently was not disposed to credit
their ability to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>"Come here, young girl!" he commanded
Nadine, and when she had stepped up to his desk
he went on: "And so you declare that somebody
has taken away your sister at the Beaulieu fair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Nadine replied.</p>

<p>"And what is your sister's age?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"She is six years old, sir."</p>

<p>"Could it not be on account of your unkind
treatment of her that your sister ran away?"
was the next query.</p>

<p>Poor Nadine flushed to the roots of her hair,
and her eye flashed indignantly at this contemptible
insinuation from the magistrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Unkind treatment!" she cried, her voice
quivering with anger. "I never treated Lydia
unkindly, as any one who knows about us can
tell you. I have always done my best to be as
tender with her as our dear mother would have
been. I can assure you, sir, that Lydia is as fond
of us as we are of her. We all four love each
other dearly, and we are very happy together,
and the idea of her leaving us of her own accord
is absurd. She must have been taken away by
some evil person&mdash;and only the good God knows
what they will do with her." Here her indignation
changed to grief, and covering her face
with her hands, she burst into tears.</p>

<p>The stern old magistrate, instead of being convinced
by the manifest sincerity and truthfulness
of the young girl, shook his head, as though to
say:</p>

<p>"That's all very fine, but I don't put much
faith in it," and after a pause put another question.</p>

<p>"Was not your sister of a very headstrong
nature?"</p>

<p>"Indeed she was not," sobbed Nadine, "she
was always most affectionate and gentle, and
perfectly obedient."</p>

<p>"We will see about that," grunted the magistrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
looking rather dissatisfied at the result of
his examination thus far.</p>

<p>He was silent for a time while he fiddled with
the papers on his desk, and then he recommenced
his questions.</p>

<p>"You pretend also that you have been robbed
of all the money you possessed while you were
asleep, and you add that that sleep was not
natural, but was caused by being drugged? Is
that the case?"</p>

<p>"That is what I have told, sir, and it is the
very truth," answered Nadine firmly, for she had
now recovered herself.</p>

<p>"A pretty story, truly," retorted the magistrate,
harshly, "and one that speaks volumes for
your imagination. But there is another part of
your story which is even more preposterous.
You assert that a kind-hearted lady gave you two
hundred francs about a month ago?"</p>

<p>"I swear to you that this is true!" exclaimed
Nadine. "When Madame Prad&#232;re gave me the
envelope I did not know what was in it, because
she impressed upon me that I must not open it
until I was in very great trouble. So I kept it
carefully, and did not open it, as we were doing
very well with our performances, and had no
trouble until this came to us. Then I thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
what she had told me, and opened the envelope
when the gendarmes were present."</p>

<p>"Young girl," said the magistrate solemnly,
"in your interest I enjoin you to make a full confession
of the real truth without any longer
attempting to mislead the law. Take my word
for it, you must not try to speak falsely as to
things which sooner or later must be found out,
if you would hope for the consideration of the
authorities before whom you are brought. So
now, my child, think well, and be perfectly frank
with me. This is no doubt only a temporary
giving away to wrong. You were strongly
tempted, and you succumbed to the temptation
by taking money which was not your own. Tell
me all, my child. Where did you get that
money?"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">NALLA OBTAINS ASSISTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Poor unhappy Nadine could stand it no longer!
The persistent incredulity of the magistrate cut
her to the heart. It was bad enough to have lost
her darling sister, and all her money, but in addition
to that to be treated like a criminal instead
of finding sympathy and assistance, truly it was
more than flesh and blood could bear. She sank
fainting to the floor in front of the judge's desk.</p>

<p>Up to this point C&#230;sar, awed by the stern manner
of the judge, and, trusting to the superior
intelligence and experience of his older sister, had
been a silent although deeply moved spectator of
the scene. But when Nadine collapsed, he sprang
forward, and spoke out in clear brave tones.</p>

<p>"Mr. Magistrate, it is no use your torturing
my sister like that. You cannot by so doing
compel her to lie. She never deceived anybody
in her life. What she has told you, sir, is perfectly
true, every word of it. The money that
you accuse her of stealing was given her by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Madame Prad&#232;re, the lady of the Mayor of the
town of Morainville."</p>

<p>"Madame Prad&#232;re!" exclaimed the magistrate,
jumping up from his chair. "Did you say
Madame Prad&#232;re?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded C&#230;sar. "Madame Prad&#232;re
who lives in a fine mansion at Morainville."</p>

<p>"Prad&#232;re! Prad&#232;re!" repeated the magistrate.
"I know him, he was lieutenant in the regiment
when I retired. We were very good friends,
Prad&#232;re and I, and we soon shall find out if you
are speaking the truth. I shall write immediately
to Morainville and institute inquiries into your
affair."</p>

<p>"Then we are saved!" cried C&#230;sar, throwing
out his arms in a gesture of relief and joy.</p>

<p>This exclamation was uttered in a tone of such
manifest sincerity that the magistrate, who was
not really as hard-hearted as he seemed, and who
had been severe towards the Tambys because
it is the custom in French courts to assume
that every person brought them is a criminal,
and to compel them to clear themselves, instead
of considering them innocent until they were
proven guilty, was profoundly impressed. He
began to fear that he had been guilty of injustice
and undue harshness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"After all," he reflected somewhat uneasily,
"the story told by these children is very touching,
and why may it not be true? I know that
as a rule these mountebanks are not by any
means good characters, but perhaps these orphans
are an exception. I must deal more gently with
them." So, with a much less severe expression,
and softer tone, he said to them, Nadine by this
time having recovered her self-possession:</p>

<p>"My children, to-morrow we shall clear up your
affairs. I shall write to Morainville requesting
an immediate answer, and, if you have told the
truth, you shall be free. But I am obliged to recommit
you to prison until to-morrow. I shall
see, however, that you are well cared for."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, it doesn't matter so much about us,"
spoke up Nadine. "We can manage to do without
food for a day. We have already done so
before, but our animals&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, to be sure," responded the magistrate.
"You have a horse, which has been put
in a stable. You need not worry about him. He
will get all he needs."</p>

<p>"But Nalla&mdash;what about him?" persisted Nadine,
seeming much concerned.</p>

<p>"Nalla!" exclaimed the magistrate rather
testily, for he was anxious to be through with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the children for the present. "Who is it that
you call Nalla?"</p>

<p>"Nalla," interposed the brigadier, "is a very
big and dangerous beast, an elephant, which has
insisted upon following us, and which at this
moment is out there before your door."</p>

<p>The magistrate went to the window and drew
aside the curtains. There was Nalla, silent and
motionless, surrounded by a curious crowd that
took care not to come too near him.</p>

<p>"Oh! ho!" he exclaimed. "What a huge
creature? Is he indeed dangerous?"</p>

<p>"He?" replied Nadine, smiling at the idea.
"He dangerous? Not a bit of it! He is as kind
as possible, and I will guarantee that he does
nobody any harm. But as he will not consent to
part from us, won't you please permit him to
remain at the prison gate until we come out
again?"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, if you assure me that he will
not do any mischief, I will consent to what you
ask," said the magistrate graciously, "and to ease
your minds, I may tell you that I will at once
give orders that a thorough search of the neighborhood
be made for any signs of your sister."</p>

<p>Nadine, her heart somewhat lightened by the
promise, thanked the old man, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
three children were escorted by the gendarmes to
the prison.</p>

<p>Here they were confined in a large cell, a bare,
comfortless chamber that was all the more objectionable
to them because of their being accustomed
to such a free open-air life. The only
source of cheer that they had was the promise of
the sous-pr&#233;fet to write to M. Prad&#232;re about
them. But, presently, even this began to cause
them uneasiness.</p>

<p>"What if Madame Prad&#232;re should be away
from home?" said Nadine with a sigh of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you remember that the kind old
gendarme said that she hardly ever went away?"
responded C&#230;sar, cheeringly.</p>

<p>"My dear brother," returned Nadine, "you
are doing your best to keep up my spirits, but you
see I am not of so hopeful a nature as you are.
It's not my fault, C&#230;sar, indeed it isn't, but I am
troubled with dark presentiments. I am weighed
down with anxiety that I cannot overcome. It
is no doubt due to what has happened during the
last two days, for I am greatly upset by it."</p>

<p>Abel joined with C&#230;sar in well-meant efforts
at consolation, and, as during the night before,
the children had had no sleep at all, they now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
began to doze off, and presently all three of them
were sound asleep.</p>

<p>But poor Nadine's rest was disturbed by unpleasant
dreams, and about midnight she awoke with
a shriek of terror.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar at once woke up and sought to find her
hand in the darkness that enshrouded them.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, dear sister?" he asked
anxiously. "Are you in pain? Answer me,
Nadine, I beg of you."</p>

<p>But Nadine made no reply, and when C&#230;sar
took her hand he found that it was cold as ice.
The sorely-tried girl had in fact fallen into a
deep swoon.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar was terrified. Nadine was silent and
motionless. Could she be dead? and there they
were, shut up in the prison, without any way of
getting assistance!</p>

<p>He set up a frantic shouting. He hammered
on the massive door with all his might only to
get back the dreary echoes of his blows. There
was nobody near at that time to hear him.
Everybody in Beaulieu was sound asleep.</p>

<p>There was one creature, however, that was
awake, and whose keen ears caught the cries
C&#230;sar uttered in his frantic concern. Nalla,
keeping patient faithful watch beside the prison-gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
heard his young master, and realizing that
he was in trouble at once started trumpeting with
all his might.</p>

<p>The appalling sound soon wakened the whole
neighborhood, and the startled folk appeared at
the windows and doors of their houses, but not
one of them ventured to approach the huge animal
from which it was proceeding.</p>

<p>On seeing that no one responded to his call
Nalla tried to break down the gate of the prison
in order to reach his young owners, and set them
at liberty. But the gate was too strong. It
successfully resisted his assault upon it. Then
the wise old creature showed his remarkable
intelligence.</p>

<p>He turned from the gate to the railing and
with one stroke of his mighty trunk laid low the
light iron bars. The way being thus cleared he
went out alone into the deserted streets of the
town.</p>

<p>Where now was he going with rapid step, and
uplifted trunk as though ready to act in his own
defense? Certainly he did not need any one to
show him the way. He evidently knew just
what he was about.</p>

<p>On he went, not in the least bothered by the
darkness of the night, until he reached the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
to which he had accompanied the children that
morning&mdash;that is to say, the residence of the
magistrate.</p>

<p>Then he came to a halt, and, without any concern
for the peaceful slumbers of the honest
townsfolk of that quarter, he proceeded to renew
his vigorous trumpeting!</p>

<p>The magistrate woke up, and hurried to the
window to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"The elephant which was left shut up in the
prison yard!" he exclaimed. "How on earth did
he get here? He'll arouse the whole town. Go
away, you brute, and be quiet!"</p>

<p>And he closed the window intending to return
to bed.</p>

<p>But Nalla had no thought of letting him alone.
He repeated his sonorous appeal.</p>

<p>Of course under the circumstances sleep was
out of the question for the magistrate. Moreover,
the whole neighborhood was stirring, although
it was not more than two o'clock of the
morning.</p>

<p>Although very angry at first, on second
thoughts the old gentleman, so rudely disturbed,
began to say to himself:</p>

<p>"After all there may be something amiss, or
why has that big brute come here? It can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
be to seek me out, and obtain my assistance? I
must investigate at once."</p>

<p>So with a certain amount of grumbling he
dressed himself, and went down, opening the
front door very carefully.</p>

<p>As soon as Nalla saw him he ceased trumpeting,
waved his trunk in joyful greeting, and, wheeling
around, set off for the prison, the magistrate
following meekly in his rear, and marveling at
the sagacity displayed by this remarkable creature.</p>

<p>On their arrival they found the gendarmes
gathered before the door, having been summoned
by the startled neighbors. "Open the door immediately,"
commanded the magistrate.</p>

<p>The brigadier, who carried a lantern, unlocked
the door, and led the way into the prison, while
the other gendarmes remained outside, preserving
a respectful distance from Nalla, who stood as
close as possible to the door, listening intently for
every sound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">NADINE'S ILLNESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On their entering the cell in which the Tambys
were confined they found Nadine lying upon the
floor, as pale and still as though she were dead.</p>

<p>The magistrate was greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"The poor child has died!" he exclaimed, taking
hold of her cold hand. "Brigadier, send one
of your men off for a doctor immediately," and
when the gendarme had hurried out he lifted
Nadine's hand tenderly.</p>

<p>"She's not dead! She is breathing!" cried the
magistrate suddenly, in a tone of relief and joy.
And he proceeded to stroke her blanched cheeks
and forehead with his hands in a gentle way that
seemed surprising in such a stern old man.</p>

<p>Presently the doctor arrived all out of breath,
for the brigadier had made him come as fast as
possible. After a careful examination of Nadine
he shook his head in a manner that was far from
reassuring.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," he said, "the child must be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
once removed to the hospital. Her unconsciousness
may continue for some hours longer, and
when she does revive it will be absolutely necessary
that she should be guarded against the
slightest excitement. I shall go to the hospital
at once and arrange for her reception."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Nadine was lying in a bed
in the hospital, and at her side were C&#230;sar and
Abel, in accordance with the directions of the
magistrate.</p>

<p>"It is best that the young girl should first see
her brothers when she comes to herself," said the
thoughtful old man, and although the brigadier
ventured to protest, he had of course to obey the
orders of his superior.</p>

<p>Not until morning did the doctor, who had not
left Nadine for a moment, give his opinion as to
the nature of her illness.</p>

<p>"She undoubtedly has an attack of brain
fever," he said, looking very grave, "and will
require great care. You must give her every
attention," he added, turning to the Sister of
Charity, in whose charge Nadine would now
be.</p>

<p>The Sister's heart was already full of sympathy
for the sweet young girl, and she replied in her
soft voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>"Be assured, sir, she shall want for nothing.
Everything possible will be done for her."</p>

<p>Despite the authority given by the magistrate,
that C&#230;sar and Abel should be permitted to
remain near their sister, it must not be supposed
that they were set at liberty. They were still
kept under surveillance, although indeed there
was small need for it. But the brigadier persisted
in believing in those two hundred francs to have
been stolen.</p>

<p>During the long anxious days while Nadine's
life hung in the balance, poor C&#230;sar did not concern
himself as to whether there had been any
answer received from Morainville, until one
morning the doctor announced that, barring fresh
complications which he could not then foresee,
Nadine would recover.</p>

<p>The two boys fairly shouted for joy at this
good news, and, his mind being thus relieved
about his sister, C&#230;sar was able to think of something
else.</p>

<p>Naturally his first thought was about the
Prad&#232;res, and he begged the brigadier, who came
to the hospital every day to make sure that his
youthful prisoners had not escaped, to take him
to the magistrate in order to find out what
answer had been received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>The brigadier at first evaded the request, by pretending
not to hear what C&#230;sar said. But
the boy reiterated his request, and the brigadier
had to reply.</p>

<p>"I must tell you, then," he said, "that your
Madame Prad&#232;re has made no reply, and this goes
to confirm my suspicions."</p>

<p>"What!" cried C&#230;sar, incredulously. "No
reply? You say that Madame Prad&#232;re has not
answered! But that is impossible! She knows
perfectly well that we didn't steal the money."</p>

<p>And, refusing to credit it, he was so importunate
that at last for very peace' sake the brigadier
took him to the magistrate.</p>

<p>"Is it true, sir!" he asked, with anxious,
apprehensive face and tone, "that Madame Prad&#232;re
has not answered the letter you wrote to her
more than a month ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, it is true," responded the magistrate
kindly. "But just to-day came the explanation
of her silence. She has suffered a great
calamity. On the very day the gendarmes put
you in prison at Beaulieu, Monsieur Prad&#232;re was
killed by a fiery horse that he was training."</p>

<p>"M. Prad&#232;re killed!" murmured C&#230;sar sadly.
"Oh! how sorry I am, and Nadine will be so
sorry too. They were such good friends to us!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"You can easily understand," continued the
magistrate, "that under such circumstances the
poor lady would not be giving attention to her
correspondence. But here now is the brief communication
that she has made to me:</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="sigleft">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>"It is quite true that I gave the
Tamby children the envelope containing the two
hundred francs. They are thoroughly honest and
very intelligent children, and I commend them to
your kind consideration.</p>

<p class="sigright">"<span class="smcap">V. Prad&#232;re.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Surely now we are free!" cried C&#230;sar so
soon as the magistrate had finished reading the
note.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, you are free," was the kindly
response. "But it will be necessary for you to
remain here for some time yet, because your sister
is not even convalescent, and her recovery
may take a long time."</p>

<p>"That is so, sir," C&#230;sar returned. "But Abel
and I will try to get work in the neighborhood
so that we may provide for ourselves and our
animals, and not be beholden to any one."</p>

<p>"You are a brave manly boy!" said the magistrate,
clapping him upon the shoulders, "and I
will interest myself in obtaining employment for
you. I will guarantee your good character."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>Thus matters went on until the middle of
November. By that time, although she had not
by any means regained her full strength, Nadine
was so determined to have her own way that the
doctor, having given her a thousand injunctions
to be very careful of herself, permitted her to
return to the van.</p>

<p>The three Tambys were then very happy at
being reunited, and in cherishing the hope that
ere long they would have their sister restored to
them.</p>

<p>Alas, the poor young things had not yet drunk
to the dregs the bitter cup of trial that had been
thrust upon them, for now Nalla began to be a
source of anxiety. He spent much of the time
lying down and refused to do his work. For long
periods he would remain motionless, taking no
interest in anything except the voices of passing
children, at which sound he would suddenly raise
his head, and would follow the children as far as
he could with his small bright eyes, while he
uttered groans like those he was wont to give
forth when playing with little Lydia.</p>

<p>Nadine and C&#230;sar had no difficulty in deciding
what was the matter with him. He was mourning
for his beloved little playmate who had so
strangely disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>For days he would not take a bit of food&mdash;although
he was usually a great eater&mdash;and this in
itself was enough to give them keen concern. Yet
nothing that they could do to comfort him had
any effect. Evidently they must simply wait for
his grief to wear away unless they could succeed
in finding Lydia in the meantime.</p>

<p>At every place they visited their first proceeding
was to make inquiry as to whether any strolling
performers had passed that way, and when they
were answered in the affirmative they would ask
if it was noticed whether they had with them a
little girl six years of age and having brown hair
and eyes.</p>

<p>But nothing came of all their eager inquiries.
Lydia seemed to have vanished utterly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the days went by, and the middle of
December found them still searching vainly for
their lost sister. The weather, which had hitherto
been unusually mild, might at any time become
cruelly cold.</p>

<p>It was with serious concern that the poor children
regarded the advent of the season which is so
hard upon the poor, and among the poor there
are surely none who feel it more than the wandering
folk who live in vans. Not only have they to
face the bitter cold as they travel from one place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
to another, but the van, which is their dwelling,
while well enough on the fine warm days of summer,
is but a poor apology for a comfortable home
when the winter winds blow fiercely.</p>

<p>What is even still more serious for these wandering
artists, their patrons naturally prefer remaining
snugly at their own firesides with their
feet toasting at the ruddy flames to standing in
the open air watching a performance while the
cold is nipping them.</p>

<p>The Tamby receipts were very scanty, and they
suffered all the more on that account, because they
had first to consider Steady and Nalla and make
sure that they were well fed, even though Nalla's
appetite was not what it used to be. They had
accordingly to buy a great deal of hay, and hay
was expensive. Nadine had always endeavored
so far as she was able to give the big creature the
things he liked, and often he would caress her
with his trunk in token of his appreciation of her
attentions, but there were no more dainties for
him now, nothing but the plainest of fare.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">IN A DESPERATE STRAIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Tambys were now in the department of
Gironde, and on the twentieth of December, about
eleven in the morning, they left Parentes in order
to go to Mamezan, a town situated on the seaside.
They had to traverse about twenty miles of
open moor and of pine woods without a single
house on the whole route, and at that time of
the year the night came on early.</p>

<p>When they were starting, Nalla, who was lying
down beside the van, seemed very reluctant to
rise, and did so only in obedience to Nadine, who
said:</p>

<p>"My friend, be brave. We must go on farther
and farther until we have found Lydia. Then
we shall be able to take a good long rest. Come
now, get up, like a good fellow. We have to be
off without delay."</p>

<p>And so with manifest reluctance the elephant
slowly rose, and followed mopingly along in the
rear of the van that Steady seemed to find increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
difficulty in dragging over the hard
roads.</p>

<p>The little party made slow progress, and at the
end of three hours had accomplished only one-half
of the journey.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a violent and icy wind blowing
in from the sea raised the sand in a way that
blinded poor old Steady, who toiled along painfully
with his head bent as low as if he would
fain bury it between his legs, and, finally, it was
necessary to halt from time to time in order to
let Nalla rest, for he seemed too feeble to walk at
all fast.</p>

<p>The sky became covered with dark heavy
clouds, and the temperature suddenly went down,
while the bitter wind continued to blow mercilessly.
Then the snow began to fall.</p>

<p>The great stretch of sand was utterly deserted
save for the solitary van with its occupants and
Nalla, and in a few minutes the whole plain was
as white as a tablecloth. The snow fell so
thickly as to completely shut out the sky and
all the world around.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar, anxious for the animals, managed to
arrange the canvas curtain of their "theater" so
that it covered Nalla's head and the most of
Steady's body, and then the three children shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
themselves up in the van with Vigilant to endure
the misery of their situation as best they could.</p>

<p>Poor old Steady kept up a dolorous whinnying
and stamping of his hoofs as he strove to kick
away the snow which banked about his feet, and
chilled his legs, while Nalla poured forth pitiful
plaints that sounded remarkably like sobs as he
cowered beneath the canvas, which was all too
small to afford him anything like adequate
shelter.</p>

<p>For more than an hour the storm raged, the
snow falling so heavily that Steady was buried in
it up to his knees, and the van up to the hubs of
the wheels.</p>

<p>After it ceased to fall the sky continued to be
dark and lowering, and to give promise of further
avalanches, and beneath the somber heavens the
immense plain spread out as far as eye could
reach, one vast expanse of blinding whiteness.</p>

<p>Oh! the white robe of cruel winter, which is in
truth the mourning of Nature, and of the unfortunate
creatures that have no snug shelter!
How saddening it is! How it chills the heart!
It is so dreadful to think of poor wretches who
have no warm hearth to sit beside, no roof to
cover them, but must suffer the pangs that the
merciless cold alone can inflict, and perhaps lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
down to die with the unpitying snow as their
winding-sheet!</p>

<p>The Tamby children, unfortunate though they
certainly were, had at least the protection of their
van, and might have been comfortable after a
fashion had not their hearts been wrung with
anxiety for their missing sister, who, for aught
they knew, was exposed to the same storm, and for
their faithful beasts cowering close to the van
that afforded them but partial shelter from the
cutting blast.</p>

<p>"Poor Nalla and Steady!" said C&#230;sar, as he
closed the door, after being out to speak encouragingly
to them, and to pat their heads. "If
they were only no bigger than Vigilant they
could come into the van with us, and we would
help to keep each other warm."</p>

<p>"It is indeed too bad they have to be out
in all this storm," murmured Nadine, her eyes
filling with tears, "and I'm very much afraid it
may make Nalla sick. He seems a good deal out
of sorts already. Oh, C&#230;sar, what would we do
if he were to die! We could never earn a living
without him!"</p>

<p>C&#230;sar put his arm around his sister, and
stroked her hair tenderly.</p>

<p>"Of course we could, dearie," he said with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
cheery confidence, much more emphatic than he
really felt. "We would not of course do quite
so well at first without the dear old fellow, who
is now the chief attraction of our entertainment,
but we would put something else in his place.
You might learn some new songs, and I some
new tricks, and Abel might do an act with Vigilant,
and so on."</p>

<p>Nadine brightened up at his encouraging words.</p>

<p>"That's the way to look at it," she responded.
"How brave you are, my brother!" Then with
a sigh that seemed to rend her heart, "But, oh!&mdash;if
we only had our little Lydia back!"</p>

<p>The storm subsided. The snowflakes grew
lighter and fewer, and the atmosphere clearer,
but the Tambys realized with much concern that
the light was waning as at the approach of night.
It was only three o'clock in the afternoon, but on
the twentieth of December darkness comes early.
Yet they were still nearly ten miles from the
town of Mamezan, which was their destination.</p>

<p>"C&#230;sar," exclaimed Nadine, rousing herself
from the sad reverie into which she had relapsed,
"we must start again at once, or we shall have
to spend the night out in this desolate plain."</p>

<p>"We must, indeed," answered C&#230;sar with a
brisk toss of the head, "but it will be precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
slow going. See, Nadine, how deep the snow is!
Steady is right up to his knees in it. I must get
him out."</p>

<p>So saying, he pulled away the canvas which had
been covering the horse and elephant, and taking
the former by the bridle, called out in the same
tone as if he were speaking to a human companion:</p>

<p>"Brace up, comrade! It will be a hard job
for you to drag the heavy van through this deep
snow, but we must be off if we don't want to
spend the night without shelter. So come along,
do your best, old chap!"</p>

<p>Steady was quite willing to show that he did
not lack good-will. He strained hard upon the
collar, and by dint of a succession of vigorous
efforts, succeeded in getting the van in motion.</p>

<p>But after a few turns of the wheels it stopped
again. The load was beyond his strength, and
the poor creature in his noble efforts to start it,
slipped upon the already hard frozen snow, and
fell heavily, injuring his knees.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar and Nadine burst into despairing tears,
in which little Abel joined. But it was only for
a moment.</p>

<p>"This won't do," cried the brave-hearted boy,
springing up and dashing away the tears as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
he were ashamed of them. "I know what I'll
try."</p>

<p>He remembered what he had seen his father do
sometimes when the road had been too soft, or the
hills too steep upon their route, and he at once
proceeded to imitate it.</p>

<p>He led Nalla out in front of the van, and
attached him by ropes to the whippletree. Then,
in as cheery a tone as he could manage, he called
out:</p>

<p>"Now, then, Nalla, help your old comrade out
of his difficulty. You see he cannot haul the
van through this deep snow alone. You must
give him the aid of your vast strength."</p>

<p>But alas! Nalla seemed to have lost all his
strength and spirit. Instead of responding to
such an appeal as the faithful, big-hearted creature
was wont to do, he collapsed upon the snow!</p>

<p>With this, all hope of the poor children being
able to get away appeared to be at an end. There
was no other alternative than to spend the night
on that appalling waste of snow.</p>

<p>Of course they would be fairly well sheltered
from the cold in their van, and, as they fortunately
had a little fuel still left, they could keep up a
small fire in the tiny cooking-stove.</p>

<p>But how about the elephant and the horse?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
What was to become of them? Something must
be done on their behalf. So C&#230;sar, Nadine and
Abel went to work to clear away the snow from
around the van, in order to make some sort of a
resting-place for the two animals.</p>

<p>It was hard work, although they went at it
with all their strength, and by the time it was
finished night was drawing near.</p>

<p>"Here now, Nalla," said C&#230;sar. "Get up, old
fellow, from that cold place, and come over to
where we have cleared all the snow away. You
will find it much more comfortable."</p>

<p>The big creature, after several vain efforts,
succeeded in getting to his feet again, and followed
C&#230;sar to the spot indicated, where he at
once lay down again.</p>

<p>Nadine was very much alarmed.</p>

<p>"C&#230;sar!" she cried, "this is something serious.
I have often seen Nalla tired out, and sometimes
sick, but never so bad as this. He no
doubt needs a warm mash to revive him, and I
haven't a thing out of which to make it."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar formed a resolution with his wonted
promptness.</p>

<p>"Nadine," he said, "I'll go right away to Mamezan
for the help we need. It is now four
o'clock. I'll be back before midnight."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE RECOVERY OF NALLA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"You're a brave boy, C&#230;sar!" cried Nadine,
her face glowing with love and pride. "But do
you realize what that would mean? You could
hardly make a mile an hour through this deep
snow. It is above your knees, and you would
soon become exhausted by wading through it.
No&mdash;no&mdash;dear brother&mdash;it would be folly to try
it, and, moreover, you cannot do it any way."</p>

<p>"Why so?" persisted C&#230;sar, who was
thoroughly in earnest. "I'm sure I can do it.
Just remember that Nalla's life is in danger. If
nothing is done for him soon he will surely die."</p>

<p>Half-convinced, Nadine looked out upon the
white wilderness, as bare, as silent, as trackless
as the ocean. North, south, east, and west not a
sign of human habitation could be discerned.
The three young occupants of the shabby old van
might have been the only people in the world.
Turning sadly to C&#230;sar, she said with a sigh
that was more like a sob:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>"In which direction will you go, C&#230;sar?"</p>

<p>C&#230;sar gazed earnestly in every direction, asking
of the horizon the question his sister had put
to him, but there was no answer forthcoming
from the encircling gloom. He had overlooked
the fact that the snow had obliterated the roads,
and that consequently he would be unable to find
his way. In a despondent tone he replied:</p>

<p>"I won't go at all, Nadine. I don't know
where Mamezan lies. We'll have to stay here for
the night, and make the best of it."</p>

<p>The big canvas was accordingly used to cover
poor old Nalla, who lay groaning dolefully, and
Steady having been tied close to the van so as to
get all the shelter it could afford, the Tambys
went to bed supperless.</p>

<p>Not a star shone in the sky, nor friendly light
glimmered in the distance. The children were
alone&mdash;utterly alone, on the great plain of which
the snow had made a white lifeless desert.</p>

<p>They threw themselves upon their beds without
undressing, and Abel, poor little chap, did not
take long to go to sleep, but C&#230;sar and Nadine
could not thus forget for a time their troubles.
Again and again did one or other of them get up
to go to Nalla, who moaned piteously, and at last,
about four o'clock, they became greatly alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
by the heartrending cries of the animal, who
appeared to be in great suffering, and unable to
lift his head from where it lay upon the frozen
ground.</p>

<p>The two children, filled with the keenest concern,
and yet powerless to do anything, remained
by the head of their faithful friend, and
at break of day were joined by Abel, who had
awakened from his sleep.</p>

<p>When Nalla lay down he instinctively turned
his head to the quarter in which the sun would
rise, as if he would see for the last time, may be,
the dawn which had always been a favorite sight
with him. And now his eyes, almost closed,
watched the first faint gray lights of a chill
winter's morning.</p>

<p>Perhaps he then had a vision of the far-away
jungle in which he was born, and where he spent
his youth. Perhaps this plain, stripped of its
winding-sheet of snow, that stretched before his
eyes, recalled to his memory those other plains
of far greater extent, which he had traversed in
his own country. Perhaps he saw, as in a mirage,
the dense thickets of luxurious vegetation in
which he had taken refuge with his own kind,
and the savage grandeur of the mysterious regions
wherein his early years had been spent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>May be Nalla in this supreme hour reviewed
the different stages of his life, from the day when,
while still a mere calf, he was captured by tamed
elephants trained to make prisoners of wild ones,
until when in his fiftieth year he became the protector
and breadwinner of the Tamby family.</p>

<p>Lydia had been his particular pet. He loved
her with the whole strength of his big heart, and
her sudden disappearance had been a rude shock
to his already failing health. The tender-hearted
creature mourned for his darling and could not
be comforted.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock it was broad daylight. But
such a day! The sky hung low and threatening.
The heavy clouds were of a sullen gray color.
The snow seemed ready to resume falling in
greater quantity. Nadine, C&#230;sar, and Abel did
not leave the side of their big friend. Nadine
tenderly patted the limp trunk, while she said,
soothingly:</p>

<p>"Don't lose heart, Nalla! It is day again,
and C&#230;sar will go to the town to get assistance
for you. We will save you, Nalla. You often
saved us in critical times, and we are not going
to let you die. You are our best friend. You
are not only our chief resource in the gaining of
our daily bread, but you are, above all, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
old and tried comrade, truest and most devoted
friend. You are, moreover, our best hope for
the recovery of Lydia&mdash;our dear little Lydia, my
good Nalla, the little Lydia of whom you are so
fond. You will live, won't you, Nalla, to love
us, and be loved by us in return?"</p>

<p>Nalla remained motionless through all Nadine's
tender appeals, yet he seemed to understand
every word she uttered. His sorrowful little
eyes were turned towards the children to tell them
that he understood, and that he was extremely
sorry to cause them so much anxiety.</p>

<p>Presently his huge body began to shake with
violent tremors. It was plain that severe pangs
tortured him, and he presented a pitiable spectacle
as he lay there upon the wild waste of snow, to all
appearances beyond the reach of assistance.</p>

<p>He could breathe now only with great difficulty,
and he made pathetic efforts to raise his head in
order to obtain the air he needed. At last the
poor creature gathered strength to lift his trunk,
and pass it around the three children, who were
sitting beside him, thus drawing them one by
one nearer to himself. There he held them for
some minutes as though seeking to have them
realize how much he was suffering, and how
deeply he was attached to them. Poor Nalla! he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
whose cradle bed had been the warm sod of the
land of sunshine, now had for sick-bed a snowdrift!</p>

<p>Suddenly C&#230;sar sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Nadine!" he said, "I believe that the cold
is making Nalla worse, and that he is likely to
die here. Can't we do something to get him
warm?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," replied Nadine. "We must try
and make him warm. But how shall we do it?"</p>

<p>"Nadine, it must be done at any cost," returned
C&#230;sar. "First of all let us clear away all the
snow from about him."</p>

<p>So once more the three children set courageously
to work at sweeping the snow away. When this
had been accomplished C&#230;sar said briskly:</p>

<p>"Now, then, let us make a fire."</p>

<p>"What shall we make it with?" asked Nadine,
looking around as if in hopes of seeing a pile of
wood somewhere.</p>

<p>"With anything&mdash;everything," responded
C&#230;sar in a determined tone. "With our van if
there is nothing else that will do."</p>

<p>At the suggestion of this extreme measure
Nadine paled, and for a moment showed hesitation.
But it was only for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, C&#230;sar," she cried, "we'll do it. We'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
make firewood of the van before we'll let Nalla
die!"</p>

<p>"But we won't begin on the van until we have
used up everything else," returned C&#230;sar.</p>

<p>Without delay they went to work upon their
fire. The trestles, the planks, and everything
else that composed their "theater," their chairs
and tables and other articles of furniture, they
were all sacrificed without demur, and the bonfire
presently assumed considerable proportions,
crackling and roaring cheerfully.</p>

<p>In its flames Nadine melted snow in a metal
basin, and made Nalla drink the warm water,
replenishing the basin again and again until he
had absorbed several gallons of it.</p>

<p>After a little, to their infinite joy the big fellow
began to show signs of improvement. He
trumpeted in a feeble way, and moved his trunk
about. His piteous groanings ceased altogether.
Manifestly he was on the mend.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Nadine!" exclaimed C&#230;sar, smiling
radiantly at these cheering signs. "You always
know just the right thing to do. That hot water
is making Nalla well again. What a clever girl
you are!"</p>

<p>Nadine was so ruddy from her exertions and
the heat of the blaze at which she was working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
that the blush of pleasure her brother's praise
evoked only added a deeper tinge as she made
haste to reply.</p>

<p>"But it was you that thought of the fire,
C&#230;sar, and if it were not for it there would be
no hot water, you know," and she patted him
lovingly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>At the end of half-an-hour Nalla got his head
up, and not long after rose to his feet, although
he was still very shaky on his great legs. But
he held his trunk high once more, and looked at
his young owners with a new brightness in his
eyes. The danger which threatened his life had
passed, and Nalla was undoubtedly saved!</p>

<p>The children were almost delirious with joy.
They hugged in turn the elephant's trunk. They
embraced one another. They danced around
their big friend singing gleefully until they were
completely tired out, and then they went back to
their beds to try and get some sleep before the
return of day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="small">IN THE NICK OF TIME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Snow! snow! snow! in flakes and flurries it
fell from the skies to the earth as though there
were no end to it. Not until ten o'clock of the
following morning did the soft avalanche cease,
and by that time so much had fallen that Abel
was lifted on to the roof of the van to sweep away
the snowy coverlet which had become threatening
through its weight, while C&#230;sar shook off the
snow that seemed to be trying to hide the canvas
which sheltered Steady.</p>

<p>He gave the old horse the remainder of the hay,
and went back inside the van to consult with
Nadine as to what had best be done. Nalla appeared
to be still suffering, but able to stand upon
his great legs.</p>

<p>The three children stood at the door of the van
and gazed eagerly over the wide white plain, and
then up at the sky. The latter looked decidedly
unpromising. There was no hint of a change for
the better in the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we certainly can't stay here!" exclaimed
C&#230;sar in a tone of decision. "We must
find some way of getting out of this fix, or we
shall all die."</p>

<p>"But how, my dear brother?" asked Nadine
despondently.</p>

<p>"I'll do what I said at first," responded C&#230;sar.
"I'll set out alone for Mamezan. I'll then hire a
man and a horse to help us and I'll procure some
food."</p>

<p>"It seems the only thing to do," said Nadine
with an anxious sigh. "You'd better go, dear,
but oh! be very careful!"</p>

<p>They had their breakfast, and Nadine after an
examination of their larder, announced that there
was sufficient food left to do Abel and her until
night if C&#230;sar did not get back sooner. So tying
a big handkerchief over his hat that it might
protect his face as much as possible, buttoning
up his coat tightly, and taking a short stick, he
embraced Nadine and Abel, and was ready to
start.</p>

<p>But in which direction was he to go? They all
three scanned the trackless plain to try and discern
some sign of a road. It was as white, as
smooth, as virgin as if no foot of man or beast
ever crossed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>Then to Nadine's bright brain came a wise
thought.</p>

<p>"When we left Parentes was not Mamezan in
the west where the sun sets, C&#230;sar?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it was," responded C&#230;sar, "but there's
no sun to be seen now, so we can't tell anything
by that."</p>

<p>"True enough," returned Nadine, her pretty
face bright with intelligence; "but you know that
Nalla every morning turns his head to the rising
sun. Last night our old friend as usual wanted
to be ready to see the dawn of the day, and he
turned towards the east. You should therefore
go in the opposite direction in which to find
Mamezan."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar's countenance lost its puzzled look, and
was brightened by a smile of comprehension.</p>

<p>"You clever girl!" he cried. "You are right,
of course, as you always are. I never saw the like
of you for thinking of things. And Nalla, dear
old Nalla, has come to our help again. Oh, what
a treasure he is!"</p>

<p>With his mind thus settled C&#230;sar once more
bade the others good-bye, and started off, trudging
manfully through the deep snow which made
the walking hard work for his young legs.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my brother!" Nadine called after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
him. "A safe journey to Mamezan, and a quick
return to deliver us from this dreadful place."</p>

<p>Fighting his way through the deep snow which
made every step a task of difficulty C&#230;sar plodded
due west, making frequent halts to get his breath,
and to glance back at the van, which stood out so
prominently, the only dark spot in that wilderness
of white.</p>

<p>He had not gone very far before he found that
Vigilant was following him, although he had not
invited him to do so.</p>

<p>"You good dog!" he cried, well pleased at
having such a companion, and stooping down
to pat him vigorously. "You're not afraid
to accompany your master instead of staying
snugly in the van. I'm so glad to have you with
me."</p>

<p>When C&#230;sar spoke thus he little guessed what
a fortunate thing the dog's devotion was to
prove.</p>

<p>Vigilant responded with a volley of barks that
confirmed his intention to stick to his master, but
had also a plaintive tone as though he would
imply that, for himself, he would have deemed it
much wiser to remain in the shelter of the van.</p>

<p>When they had been walking for about two
hours Vigilant lay down and held up his paws in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
a significant way, at the same time barking
piteously.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter, Vigilant?" asked
C&#230;sar with concern. "Are your feet hurting
you?"</p>

<p>As the animal continued his appeals C&#230;sar
picked him up, and examined his paws. The
poor little things were extremely sore from contact
with the hard frozen snow and not fit to be
walked upon.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" exclaimed C&#230;sar. "There's
nothing for it but to carry you," and gathering
the dog in his arms he renewed his toilsome
tramp thus burdened.</p>

<p>But he was suffering in no small measure
himself. The cruel cold attacked his face, his
hands and his feet mercilessly, and to make
matters worse, his boots, which were in sore need
of repairs, failed to keep out the snow with which
they were now filled. Every step was pain. But
he struggled on heroically, carrying the heavy
dog.</p>

<p>About three in the afternoon his eyes were
gladdened by the sight of a column of smoke
rising to the sky a long way off.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he cried, "I'm in the right direction.
I will reach a house soon," and encouraged by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
this prospect, he pushed ahead with renewed vigor,
although his strength was fast failing, and the
walking grew no easier.</p>

<p>That smoke meant Mamezan without doubt,
and Mamezan meant relief for them all. He
must get there before night.</p>

<p>For another half-hour he plowed laboriously
through the drifts, and by the end of that time
the roofs of Mamezan hove into sight through
the fading light of the day already drawing to a
close.</p>

<p>But alas! with the haven getting so near he
began to feel that he should not be able to reach
it. His whole system was on the verge of complete
collapse. Agonizing pains shot through his
body like stabs from red-hot needles. Then a
roaring filled his ears. He became blind and
dizzy, and, at last, succumbing to his sufferings,
he fell unconscious upon the snow!</p>

<p>Vigilant, standing by his master, howled dismally.
His paws having got warm while C&#230;sar
carried him in his arms, he was able to use them
again, and he ran hither and thither barking
frantically, while C&#230;sar with pallid hands and
face lay motionless.</p>

<p>Seeing that his young master made no response
to his appeals Vigilant lifted his head, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
about him in every direction. Then, after a
moment's pause he set off at full speed in the
direction of Mamezan.</p>

<p>It was now night&mdash;a cold dark December night.
Vigilant kept on at a good pace until suddenly he
stopped, and turned about. He heard the sound
of a bell, and saw a good way off the gleam of a
light that was not still, but was moving towards
him, while the tinkling of the bell grew clearer.</p>

<p>With a joyous bark that meant as plainly as
words:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! there's some one who will help us,"
Vigilant scampered over the snow in the direction
of the light.</p>

<p>It was borne by the rider of an old and tired
horse, and this rider was the old cur&#233; of Mamezan,
P&#232;re Blandini&#232;re, who was returning to the
town after having dispensed extreme unction to
a dying member of his congregation. From time
to time he chirruped to his steed, which seemed
almost exhausted.</p>

<p>The good man was greatly surprised at the
sudden appearance of Vigilant, whose sharp
barks demanded prompt attention, and he turned
the rays of the lantern upon the faithful creature.</p>

<p>"Why, bless me!" he exclaimed, bringing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
horse to a halt, which was only too easily done.
"What's the meaning of a dog like this being
away out here alone at such an hour of the
night?"</p>

<p>For he saw at once that it was no common
farmer's dog, but a poodle of high breeding that
was barking so insistently at his horse's feet.</p>

<p>So soon as Vigilant saw that he had attracted
the cur&#233;'s attention he sat up on his hind legs,
and begged for help in a way that could not be
misunderstood.</p>

<p>Then, dropping on all fours, he darted off in
the direction where C&#230;sar was, and as quickly
returned to resume his entreaties. The wise old
man at once grasped the situation.</p>

<p>"I understand you, you clever animal!" he
said in a tone of great kindliness. "Your master
has succumbed to the cold, and you want me to
help him. Lead me to him then, I will follow
at once, and the good God grant I may be in
time!"</p>

<p>Vigilant, the moment he saw his meaning was
understood, gave a volley of joyous barks, and
rushed off towards where he had left C&#230;sar, coming
back every few yards to make sure that the
cur&#233; was following, for in his impatience he went
much faster than the wearied old horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>A little later the cur&#233; was bending over the
motionless form of C&#230;sar.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" he murmured with deep sympathy.
"He still breathes, but he would assuredly have
died but for this wonderfully intelligent animal."</p>

<p>He at once set to work chafing C&#230;sar's hands
and cheeks, and, presently, wrapping him in his
own cloak, lifted him up on to the saddle, holding
him there while he himself walked beside the
horse, then, followed by Vigilant, who marched
along with head and tail erect in proud satisfaction
at having brought rescue to his beloved
master, they in due time reached the presbytery.</p>

<p>The cur&#233; had the still unconscious boy put into
a warm bed, where before long he recovered his
senses, and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>He looked about the bright cosy room with
wondering inquiry, and caught the eye of the
kind priest, who was sitting near him conning
his breviary and repeating the familiar words to
himself as the movement of his lips showed.</p>

<p>"Ah! ha!" exclaimed P&#232;re Blandini&#232;re in a
tone of satisfaction as he rose from his seat, and
approached the bed. "You have come back to
life, eh? I felt sure you would. You are too
sturdy a lad to let the cold put an end like that
to you. And how are you feeling now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>C&#230;sar felt so languid, and at the same time so
entirely comfortable in the soft warm bed that
his inclination was to lie still and say nothing.
But he was too courteous a boy to do that, and,
moreover, as soon as his senses returned, he
began to think about the others, Nadine and
Abel, who were so anxiously awaiting his
return.</p>

<p>Instinctively he tried to get up, but the cur&#233;
gently pressed him back into the bed.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;my son," he said, kindly yet firmly.
"Just stay where you are for the present. But
if you feel strong enough pray tell me your
story."</p>

<p>"But Nadine, and Abel, and Nalla," cried
C&#230;sar. "They must be saved," and his big
dark eyes glowed with intense earnestness as he
clasped his hands like one in prayer.</p>

<p>"And they shall be saved, my son," responded
the cur&#233; soothingly. "Never fear, they shall be
saved. Tell me all about them."</p>

<p>Relieved by this assurance C&#230;sar, now fully
master of himself, made haste to tell the story of
the van and how it was lost in the wilderness of
snow.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="small">IN CARE OF THE CUR&#201;.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The good cur&#233; listened with sympathetic interest.</p>

<p>"Help shall be sent to them without delay," he
said. "Your clever dog will no doubt be able to
guide those who shall go straight to the van, and
now if you will drink this warm soup which my
servant has just brought in, and then compose
yourself to sleep, which you greatly need, you
may count on finding your brother and sister here
when you wake again."</p>

<p>C&#230;sar obeyed without question. He had perfect
faith in the benevolent priest. The welcome
soup sent thrills of comfort through his whole
frame, and as soon as he had drunk the last drop
his head fell back upon the pillow, and he sank
into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cur&#233; had organized a party of
rescue. Late as the hour was he had no difficulty
in getting willing responses to his appeals, and
in a short time several men leading two strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
horses set out to find the van, Vigilant proudly
acting as guide.</p>

<p>The sagacious animal took them straight to
the spot, and at their coming, Nadine, whose
nerves had been enduring so cruel a strain, burst
into tears of joy, while Abel capered about shouting:</p>

<p>"We're saved! We're saved!" and then throwing
himself upon Vigilant, rolled him over in the
snow in the exuberance of his delight.</p>

<p>The horses were promptly attached to the van,
replacing poor old tired-out Steady, who joined
Nalla at the rear, and the little procession moved
towards Mamezan at a good pace.</p>

<p>Father Blandini&#232;re with the aid of his warmhearted
housekeeper had everything ready at the
presbytery for the reception of Nadine and Abel,
and for the accommodation of their animals.
They were all well fed, and then retired to rest,
the children in comfortable beds, and the animals
in a warm stable.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when C&#230;sar awoke, and
being of a strong constitution, he found himself
little the worse for the exposure of the previous
night. He lay there for a while enjoying the
luxury of the soft bed, and then his desire to know
about Nadine and Abel impelled him to get up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>He made his way down-stairs, and opening the
door, was rejoiced to see the familiar old van in
the yard with the faithful Nalla standing beside
it, and seeming to be quite himself again.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;there's your little house on wheels with
everything belonging to it," said a kind voice
behind him, and C&#230;sar, turning around, saw the
cur&#233;'s housekeeper smiling pleasantly upon him.
"But you must not expect to see your sister and
brother for a while yet. They are still sound
asleep. They were quite worn out, the poor
things!"</p>

<p>C&#230;sar thanked her warmly for her kindness to
them, and went out to the stable to see how
Steady was, stopping on the way to pat Nalla's
trunk, and to say affectionately:</p>

<p>"You dear monster! I'm so glad you're
better. I hope you'll not be ill like that again."</p>

<p>Old Steady set up a joyous neighing as soon as
he heard his young master's footsteps. There
was nothing the matter with him, and after
making his little demonstration he resumed
munching the excellent hay with which the
manger was liberally supplied.</p>

<p>It was not until midday that Nadine and Abel
awoke, and as the three children were exchanging
embraces the housekeeper came to say that dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
was ready, and that the cur&#233; invited them all to
dine with him.</p>

<p>Wonderfully refreshed by their sound sleep,
delighted at being together again in so comfortable
an establishment, and with the keenest of
appetites, the three children followed the housekeeper
into the dining-room where they were
graciously received by the benevolent cur&#233;.</p>

<p>M. Blandini&#232;re seated them at the table, and
saw to it that they had thoroughly enjoyed the
steaming savory soup before he asked them any
questions.</p>

<p>Then he drew them out to talk about themselves,
and to tell him their whole story, to which
he listened with deep interest and sympathy. He
had reached the age of seventy years, for two
score of which he had been the cur&#233; of Mamezan,
where he was universally beloved for his good
deeds, and amiable qualities. He was the kind
providence of the unfortunate, the confidant of
the young, the most trusted friend of the old, the
comforter of the sorrowing, the one whose presence
was sought above all others by those drawing
near the dread Valley of the Shadow.</p>

<p>When Nadine in her clear sweet way had finished
her recital, the good man murmured as he
placed his soft white hand gently upon her head:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little things! Poor little things! Orphans!
Left alone in the world at the very time
when most in need of counsel and protection!"</p>

<p>Then he was silent for a moment while the
children fixed their eyes upon his wrinkled countenance
that expressed benignity in every line.
Presently he spoke:</p>

<p>"I am very poor, my dears, and am not able to
do much for you, but however poor one may be
it is their duty to share what they have with those
who are still worse off. Your purpose is, you say,
to continue your journey that you may recover
your sister, and earn your living. That is right,
I approve of your resolution, but you are worn
out. You need a good rest before you can proceed,
and I am going to keep you for a while.
We will take good care of your elephant so that
he may regain his health, and will look after your
horse and dog. The Christmas festival is at hand.
We will join you in praying to the good God that
He will restore to you the little one for whom you
mourn. I will allow you to give a performance
at Mamezan before you leave&mdash;that is, after the
Christmas f&#234;tes. For the present you are my
guests, and I want you to enjoy yourselves
thoroughly."</p>

<p>With brimming eyes and quivering lips, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
kindness of the cur&#233; moved them deeply, Nadine
and C&#230;sar tried to find words in which to express
their gratitude, while Abel, inspired by one of the
happy impulses of childhood, slipped down from
his chair, and gliding to the cur&#233;'s side, put up
his face, whispering:</p>

<p>"Please may I kiss you, I love you."</p>

<p>Bending over the little chap, Father Blandini&#232;re
encircled him with his arm, and imprinted a kiss
upon his plump cheek, murmuring to himself:</p>

<p>"Truly, of such is the Kingdom of Heaven!"</p>

<p>That afternoon, as the three children were
strolling about the streets of Mamezan, and
felicitating themselves upon the happy turn in
their fortunes, Nadine stopped suddenly and
said:</p>

<p>"But how can we repay the cur&#233;'s kindness?
We are poor&mdash;poorer than ever before, and our
future is very uncertain."</p>

<p>"Nadine," responded C&#230;sar, looking very wise,
"I know something that will greatly please the
cur&#233;. I have spoken to the sacristan, and he said
it was a capital idea, and I promised him to carry
it out."</p>

<p>"And what did you promise?" asked Nadine
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is my secret, which I shall keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
carefully," responded C&#230;sar. "But I assure you
that it will give the cur&#233; great pleasure."</p>

<p>After the evening meal, which they had at an
early hour, they all went to bed to get a good
sleep before midnight. In good time the housekeeper
aroused them, and, having dressed carefully,
they went to the village church, Nadine
and Abel in company with the housekeeper, while
C&#230;sar, so full of his secret that he could hardly
trust himself to speak, joined the sacristan, who
was evidently waiting for him.</p>

<p>They found the church already well filled for the
celebration of the midnight mass. There were
bronzed fishermen and bearded miners by the
score, for it was a custom faithfully observed in
that village that the men should never miss
the Christmas Mass if they could possibly be
present.</p>

<p>At the last stroke of midnight the priest, good
Father Blandini&#232;re, took his place before the
altar, and the solemn service began.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that at Mamezan they
were not very exacting in regard to the singing
of the chants. There was only the sacristan, who
in a hard, rough voice led a handful of boys, who
had very little notion either of time or tune. Indeed,
it was quite a grief to the venerable priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
that he could not have better music at his church.
But the people were too poor to pay for an organ
and an organist, and so they had to be content
with the well-meaning but far from harmonious
sacristan.</p>

<p>The choir, if it may be so called, was placed in
a little gallery over the main entrance, and into
this gallery C&#230;sar followed the sacristan.</p>

<p>Nadine had wondered why he did not go with
them to the church, and had been looking for
him all over the building. At last she caught
sight of him in the gallery, and gave a start of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, what can C&#230;sar be doing there?" she
said to herself. Just then the sacristan made a
sign to him, and he advanced to the front of the
gallery with his mandolin in hand.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="small">THE RETURN TO MORAINVILLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the first sweet notes fell from C&#230;sar's
fingers, the congregation turned their heads to
see what this novel music meant, and Nadine,
catching Abel's arm, whispered:</p>

<p>"Now I know the secret. C&#230;sar is going to
sing '<i>Minuit Chr&#233;tien</i>,' he knows it perfectly."</p>

<p>Then a great silence settled upon the worshipers.
It seemed as if they hardly breathed in their
eager expectancy.</p>

<p>M. Blandini&#232;re was taken completely by surprise.
The secret had been well kept. But he
felt it in his heart that all would be well, and,
pausing before beginning the <i>Pater Noster</i>, he
stood with his arms outstretched towards his people,
and the tears dimming his eyes while C&#230;sar's
clear sweet voice filled the church with the lovely
music of the <i>Cantique de Noel</i>.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful and impressive scene.
Thrilled with the purest emotions, Nadine stood
as in a dream. But for one thing, she would
have been in a very heaven of joy&mdash;if only little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Lydia stood beside her with Abel! Instinctively
her heart was lifted to the good God that he
would soon restore her darling sister to her.</p>

<p>When C&#230;sar finished there followed an interval
of silence, and then the noble old priest,
turning from the altar to the people, chanted in
a voice trembling with tears, the <i>Pater Noster</i>.</p>

<p>For the first time in its history, the old church
of Mamezan had heard the notes of a mandolin,
and for the first time also, perhaps, had the simple
villagers listened to so sweet and touching
a rendering of the exquisite <i>Cantique de Noel</i>.</p>

<p>When the midnight Mass was ended the congregation
returned to their homes, and for some
time there echoed through the still, cold air of
the night the clatter of their sabots upon the
hard frozen ground.</p>

<p>The Tambys went back to the presbytery where
Father Blandini&#232;re, taking C&#230;sar's hands in his,
thanked him in these sincere, simple words:</p>

<p>"I thank you, my dear child, with all my
heart. You have afforded me a great pleasure
this night."</p>

<p>The Christmas celebration being over the children
began preparations to leave Mamezan and
the good cur&#233; who had proved so timely a benefactor.
M. Blandini&#232;re had given them permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
to give one performance before leaving the
village. But they were very much concerned
regarding it. Their program now seemed to
be so sadly shortened with Lydia gone, and their
"theater" destroyed. There remained just the
amusing act of Steady and Vigilant, C&#230;sar's
sleight-of-hand tricks and Nadine's pretty songs,
excepting, of course, Nalla, who was their strongest
card.</p>

<p>But they could not wait to rehearse new acts,
for they must lose no further time in prosecuting
the search for Lydia.</p>

<p>So the performance proved a disappointment,
and the takings were very meager indeed. The
Mamezan folk, it is true, were mostly poor, and
had little money to spare, yet all the same it was
with heavy hearts that they bade good-bye to the
kind cur&#233; and once more took the road.</p>

<p>They were not far beyond the boundaries of
the village, for poor old Steady made slow progress
with the heavy van, when a man caught
hold of his bridle, and made him stop, which indeed
he was only too glad to do.</p>

<p>"My children, you go no farther in that
direction. I have come for you."</p>

<p>Nadine, C&#230;sar, and Abel instead of being
alarmed at this startling action, joined in an exclamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of surprise and joy, for it was not a
highway robber that had thus halted them, but
an old acquaintance whom they were delighted
to recognize&mdash;no other than the kind old constable
of Morainville, who had so befriended them at
that place.</p>

<p>What could <i>he</i> be doing there&mdash;nearly a hundred
miles away from home?</p>

<p>Divining their astonishment at his appearance
the constable made haste to speak.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to see me, no doubt. For
eight days have I been following you stage by
stage of your journey. I have good news for
you."</p>

<p>"Lydia!" at once cried the three children together.
She was their first thought. No matter
what their trials might be they seemed as nothing
to them in comparison with the loss of Lydia.</p>

<p>But the constable shook his head.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not Lydia yet," he answered in a lower
tone. "We shall find her soon, never fear. But
I have come to take you back with me."</p>

<p>"To take us back with you?" exclaimed Nadine.
"What do you mean, my dear constable?"</p>

<p>"Just what I say," the old man responded,
smiling upon her. "It is the order of Madame
Prad&#232;re. She has sent me for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame Prad&#232;re!" echoed Nadine, her own
countenance brightening at the mention of the
name. "Our kind benefactress! Does she really
want us to go to her?"</p>

<p>"To be sure!" returned the constable, who
evidently enjoyed his mission. "You don't
know how sorely she has been bereaved since
you were at Morainville."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I do," replied Nadine, softly, her eyes
filling with tears. "She lost her husband by a
dreadful accident."</p>

<p>"Ah! She has changed greatly since then,"
the constable went on. "Her hair has become
almost white. There was a time when they
feared for her reason."</p>

<p>"The poor lady!" murmured Nadine. "How
she must have suffered!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ah yes!" sighed the constable. "And
she wants to be comforted in her loneliness. She
has neither husband nor children now, and so
she sent me off to find you, and bring you back.
She has resolved to take care of you for the
future."</p>

<p>Nadine and C&#230;sar looked at one another in bewilderment.
What could the constable mean?
If they did not know how good and kind he was
they might have thought he was out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
senses. Madame Prad&#232;re to adopt them! Surely
it was too good to be true!</p>

<p>But the constable soon convinced them that he
was altogether in earnest. Madame Prad&#232;re had
sent him for them, and they must return with
him. He had his orders, and he was bound to
carry them out. So, casting away all doubt,
they placed themselves under his guidance.</p>

<p>Nalla and Steady were then turned about, and
pointed in precisely the opposite direction. That
is, they were to proceed due north instead of due
south.</p>

<p>It was the constable's first experience of traveling
by van, and he took to it very kindly, saying
over and over again that it was decidedly a most
pleasant means of locomotion.</p>

<p>"You certainly get a good view of the country,
and have time to become well acquainted with it,"
was his sagacious comment.</p>

<p>He had ample funds wherewith Madame
Prad&#232;re had thoughtfully provided him, and the
Tambys enjoyed every needed comfort, while
the animals were fed as never before.</p>

<p>Under this generous treatment Nalla completely
recovered his health, and old Steady
positively grew fat, the ribs that had been showing
so plainly going quite out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>For a score of days they traveled steadily but
slowly, and what between entire relief from all
anxiety as to their daily bread, the unwonted
abundance of excellent food, and their thoroughly
healthy outdoor life in the pleasant company of
the genial constable, the three children improved
wonderfully in appearance, so that by the time
they reached Morainville they were each and all
looking their very best.</p>

<p>It was with an amusing yet surely pardonable
air of proud satisfaction that the constable conducted
them to the Prad&#232;re chateau.</p>

<p>He had taken the precaution of informing
Madame Prad&#232;re in advance of their arrival, and
she was ready to receive them with a warm and
tender greeting.</p>

<p>Nadine was touched to tears when she saw how
the good lady had altered and aged in the short
space of time since she parted from her. Her
abundant hair was almost snow-white, her beautiful
features were deeply lined, and her step had
lost all its spring. She moved and spoke softly.</p>

<p>But there was no mistaking her pleasure at the
return of the children. Both from the magistrate
at Beaulieu, and Father Blandini&#232;re she
had had letters in regard to them. She knew
much of their sufferings, and she was eager to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
console them for their trials, and to forget her
own sorrows in the endeavor to make them
happy.</p>

<p>"My dear children," she said after she had
embraced them in turn, "it is because I myself
have suffered that I want you, who are still so
young, to forget your many tribulations. I once
had children of my own. The good God gave
them to me. But He took them from me again,
and now I want to fill the empty place that they
have left. I shall take entire care of you, and
shall be responsible for your future. You shall
share all that I possess, and be denied nothing
that will be for your good. The search for your
sister Lydia shall be continued until she is found
and restored to you. And now, my dear children,
are you content to accept my proposal?"</p>

<p>Content to accept her offer&mdash;the advantages
and attractions of which were so great that they
could scarcely credit their understanding of it&mdash;?
Indeed they were content&mdash;and more&mdash;they were
filled with rapture and gratitude. It meant their
admission into a veritable Paradise. No more
hunger&mdash;no more cold&mdash;no more anxiety about
food or clothing&mdash;no more rough or rascally
people to deal with&mdash;oh, how good it was of God
to give them such a friend!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="small">REUNITED AT LAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The days that followed were very happy ones
for the Tamby children, and dear kind Madame
Prad&#232;re found wonderful soothing of her own
sorrows in the frank delight they showed at the
ease and luxury they now enjoyed.</p>

<p>The Prad&#232;re chateau was surrounded by ample
grounds in which Nalla was provided with a
roomy substantial stable for himself, and through
which C&#230;sar loved to roam accompanied by
Vigilant, who evidently quite appreciated being
relieved of all rehearsals and public performances.</p>

<p>The old van, that had so long been the only
home the children possessed, was put in a corner
of the carriage-yard where Abel, who soon found
plenty of playmates, had great fun with it, using
it now as a house, and again as a fort, and so on
after the manner of youngsters with a lively
imagination.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight Madame Prad&#232;re
said to the two boys:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we must see to your education. You
must be well fitted for the career that is before
you, and so I have arranged that you shall enter
the Lyc&#233;e to-morrow, if you have no objections."</p>

<p>Both C&#230;sar and Abel were only too glad to
obey. What education they possessed had been
given them by their parents, who had done their
best under the difficult circumstances of their
lives. But it was of course very imperfect and
no one realized this more keenly than C&#230;sar, who
had not a lazy bone in his body, and was charged
with ambition to be of some account in the world,
while Abel was inspired by his big brother, whom
he fairly worshiped.</p>

<p>Nadine would remain by the side of Madame
Prad&#232;re, who desired no better companion than
the charming girl with her gentle ways, sweet
voice, quick intelligence, and tender heart, whose
one thought was to bring sunshine into the
shadowed heart of her benefactress.</p>

<div class="tb">
    * <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span>
</div>

<p>Ten years have come and gone, and many things
have happened, the recital of which would fill
another book, so that of course it cannot be given
here. Suffice it to say that they were years full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of happiness for the Tambys, and of proud satisfaction
for Madame Prad&#232;re, who every day
found cause to congratulate herself upon having
taken them into her home and heart.</p>

<p>Nadine, now twenty-six years of age, had grown
into a beautiful woman with a grace and dignity
of manner and sincerity of heart that rendered
her inexpressibly charming. She was devoted to
Madame Prad&#232;re, who regarded her just as if she
were her own daughter, placing absolute confidence
in her, and giving her every advantage
that wealth and culture could procure.</p>

<p>In no part of her duties as Madame's lieutenant
did Nadine take more delight than in ministering
to the poor and suffering. Her own early experience
had taught her the miseries of poverty and
sickness, and she was indefatigable in doing good,
so that all Morainville esteemed and loved her as
they did Madame Prad&#232;re.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar for a time gave his sister and his patroness
considerable concern. He did not take kindly
to book-learning, and made a poor showing at the
Lyc&#233;e, the truth of the matter being that he was
possessed by a passion for a quite different kind of
study. His ambition was to be a singer.</p>

<p>As he grew older his voice, so strong and sweet
in boyhood, had developed into a singularly fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
tenor, and, having a quick and true ear, as well
as the gift of dramatic expression, he was in great
demand among Madame Prad&#232;re's friends, who
made a great deal of him.</p>

<p>At first both Nadine and Madame Prad&#232;re were
opposed to his adopting singing as a career.
They would have preferred some more ordinary
profession, but when they saw that C&#230;sar's heart
was set upon it, and that he would never be content
at anything else, they gave way, and he was
sent to the Conservatory, whence in due time he
graduated with the medal of honor.</p>

<p>It is now late in December, and they are all at
the chateau except C&#230;sar, who has just made his
d&#233;but in opera at Paris, and scored a grand success.
The journals were unanimous in their
praise, and in acclaiming the appearance of a new
tenor of the first quality for whom they confidently
predicted a brilliant career. Madame
Prad&#232;re, and Nadine have been thrilled with pride
and joy over the triumph of their loved one, and
there is no longer any question as to the wisdom
of his choice of a profession. C&#230;sar having thus
justified himself in the fullest measure, is returning
to the chateau for a short holiday, and his
coming is eagerly awaited.</p>

<p>The chateau was ablaze with lights, and stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
with bustle, for Madame Fran&#231;oise, the sharp-tongued
housekeeper, who was nevertheless the
most faithful of servants, was sparing no pains to
make C&#230;sar's reception as brilliant as possible.</p>

<p>Nadine, her countenance radiant, and her eyes
aglow, looked more than usually lovely, while
Abel, a comely lad now nearing his majority,
presented a fine appearance in his cadet uniform.</p>

<p>Vigilant was still alive, although very feeble.
He was wholly blind, and almost deaf, and never
ventured outside the inclosure of the chateau.
Nevertheless when feeling in good spirits, and on
being taken notice of, he would make an effort at
remembering his accomplishments, and do his
best to stand upon his hind legs, and salute with
his fore-paws as of old. But he was very tottery
in his doing of it.</p>

<p>Out in the park Nalla lived a life of luxurious
leisure. Being only a little over sixty years of
age he was, for an elephant, still in the heyday
of youth, and enjoyed himself immensely, having
plenty of room to roam around, abundant food of
the best quality, and a spacious lodge into which
to retire if the weather was inclement.</p>

<p>Nadine never failed to pay him a daily visit,
and, catching sight of her at a distance, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
trumpet joyfully, making the welkin ring with
raucous exclamations.</p>

<p>Poor old Steady had long ago lain down never
to rise again, dying contentedly of old age after
his life of toil and trouble.</p>

<p>In good time C&#230;sar arrived. He had grown
into a very handsome man. With his father's
stalwart shapely figure, and his mother's regular
features, and fine brown eyes, he had inherited
many of the good qualities of both parents.
Through all his experiences of the world and its
temptations he had remained a frank, fearless,
unsullied boy who loved his sister Nadine to the
point of adoration, and regarded Madame Prad&#232;re
as the best and kindest of friends to whom he could
never be sufficiently grateful.</p>

<p>The reunion was an inexpressibly happy one.
The young people had a thousand things to tell
each other, and as they chatted away like magpies,
Madame Prad&#232;re watching them with tear-dimmed
eyes, but swelling heart, murmured
softly:</p>

<p>"The good God bless them! They are the sunshine
of my life."</p>

<p>At breakfast the following morning C&#230;sar
surprised her by asking permission to take Nadine
away with him for a few days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you wish to take her, C&#230;sar?"
Madame Prad&#232;re inquired.</p>

<p>"I want to fulfill a vow that I made the day I
entered the Conservatory," answered C&#230;sar, and
on his explaining what the vow was, Madame at
once said:</p>

<p>"I heartily approve, C&#230;sar. It will be a lovely
thing to do, and not only shall Nadine and
Abel accompany you, but I shall also go with
you."</p>

<p>Two days later Madame and the three young
people took the midday train at the railway
station, it being the twenty-third of December.</p>

<p>Where were they going&mdash;and how was it that
Madame Prad&#232;re, who had not gone out since her
husband's death, went with them?</p>

<p>These were the questions that set Morainville
agog, but the secret was well kept, and no one
could answer them, save with a mere guess.</p>

<p>Their destination was the little village of Mamezan,
which they now revisited after an absence
of ten years, and in which they found
little change, except that there were many more
crosses in the cemetery beside the shabby old
church.</p>

<p>Good Father Blandini&#232;re was still in charge,
but the venerable priest was very frail, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
over eighty years of age, the oldest cur&#233; and the
most beloved in the whole country.</p>

<p>Night had come, and with it the snow. From
the windows of the Mamezan houses the light
streamed out upon the ill-kept sidewalks, which
as it drew towards midnight began to be crowded
with the villagers clattering noisily in their
wooden sabots.</p>

<p>They were all going in the one direction, that
is, churchward, for the Christmas midnight Mass
was about to be celebrated.</p>

<p>The little edifice was crowded by reverent worshipers,
but who were the strange ladies in such
rich attire, and the strapping young fellow in the
rich uniform?</p>

<p>Nobody knew, although every one tried hard
to get a good look at them, and to see if they
could not recognize them.</p>

<p>Presently the little bell tinkled, and the aged
priest slowly descended the altar steps. He seemed
very feeble, and his long hair, white as the snow
outside, lay upon his shoulders. With trembling
hands he elevated the Host while the congregation
kneeled, and the bell once more tinkled.</p>

<p>At that moment the clear, sweet notes of a
mandolin floated down from the little gallery
over the entrance, and then a superb tenor voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
of wonderful power and expression, began the
beautiful <i>Cantique de Noel</i>:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i4" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">"Tout bruit s'&#233;teint, le soir s'ach&#232;ve</div>

<div class="i4" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">L'enfant c&#232;de &#224; l'heure du r&#234;ve</div>

<div class="i2">Rare joys in sleep beholding.</div>
<div class="i6">Noel! Noel!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>At the first notes, the old priest instinctively
turned towards his flock. It was the same chant
that ten years before had been sung by the young
mountebank. But the voice was not that of the
boy, although the playing of the mandolin was
surely the same.</p>

<p>With brimming eyes and fluttering heart the
old man listened as though spell-bound. Never
before had such glorious music filled his obscure
little church. It was as though an angel sang.</p>

<p>When the service concluded, Madame Prad&#232;re
and the Tambys remained to exchange greetings
with Father Blandini&#232;re. The venerable cur&#233;
was so deeply moved that he found difficulty in
speaking. He embraced Nadine, and C&#230;sar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Abel, affectionately, murmuring, in a scarcely
audible voice:</p>

<p>"My dear children! My dear children! It is
good of God to permit me to see you again, and
all so happy!"</p>

<p>The travelers had arranged to leave for home
on the following evening, but they were told that
a traveling circus was to give a great performance
that evening, and C&#230;sar begged Madame
Prad&#232;re to remain over, as he was anxious to be
present.</p>

<p>"It will remind us," he said to Nadine, "of
the poor little representation that we gave here
ten years ago, when we were in such hard luck."</p>

<p>Madame Prad&#232;re readily consented, and in the
evening they all went to the circus, which they
found crowded to its utmost capacity.</p>

<p>The performance was a very good one of its
kind. There were expert acrobats, tumblers,
tight-rope walkers, bare-back riders, and several
highly-amusing clowns. One clown, called
"Mossieu Frisch," was particularly diverting with
his jokes and antics. C&#230;sar, looking at him
closely, was suddenly impressed with the idea
that he had seen him before. But when, and
where? His recollection was confused. He could
neither identify nor locate the funny fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the attendants began to place hurdles
about the ring, and to bring in large hoops covered
with parti-colored paper. Then Mossieu
Frisch announced with a great flourish that the
world-renowned equestrienne, Mademoiselle Rosalba,
would perform her thrilling feats. At the
same moment a superb snow-white horse, having
on its back a broad pad covered with satin and
spangles, galloped into the ring, followed by a
pretty girl in circus costume, who leaped lightly
to the pad.</p>

<p>The instant she appeared there rang out above
the music of the band a threefold cry of</p>

<p>"Lydia! Lydia! Lydia!"</p>

<p>The equestrienne sprang to the ground, stood
for a moment as if she doubted what eyes and
ears were telling her, and then, darting across
the ring, threw herself into the outstretched
arms of Nadine and C&#230;sar and Abel, that encircled
her so as almost to hide her from sight.</p>

<p>For it was Lydia&mdash;their own darling sister&mdash;so
long lost, and now by kind Providence restored
to them.</p>

<p>A scene of great excitement ensued. The
spectators marveled what it all meant, and
whether it was some novel feature of the performance.
The performance was of course suspended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and presently the ubiquitous gendarmes
appeared to make inquiry.</p>

<p>C&#230;sar called upon them to arrest Mossieu
Frisch, whom he felt sure had been responsible
for Lydia's abduction, and they at once laid hands
upon him, and took him off to prison. He was
indeed the very man who had put his van in
place of theirs at Beaulieu, and had afterwards
so startled Nadine by peeping in through the
window when they were reckoning up their
receipts.</p>

<p>It appeared that the circus had but recently
returned to France after many years traveling
through Italy and Germany, and that was why
all efforts to trace and rescue Lydia had been in
vain.</p>

<p>So&mdash;all's well that ends well. Lydia, despite
her hard life with the circus, had grown into a
very attractive girl, little spoiled by her surroundings.
Madame Prad&#232;re's party had but four
members when it left Morainville, but five when
it returned. The kind-hearted lady was only too
delighted to have one more child to mother, and
the Tambys rejoiced beyond description at the
restoration of the sister about whose absence
they had never ceased to grieve.</p>

<p>The future stretched before them with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
promise of happiness. They had had their hard
times, and their bitter griefs, and had borne
them bravely. Now through a beneficent Providence
these were all over and past. And richly
they deserved their good fortune, for, amid all
their vicissitudes had they not kept their lives
pure, and their hearts simple?</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
